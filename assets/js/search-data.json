If using Linux kernel 5.6 or higher, skip this step. | Download the relevant package for your distribution from the releases page. | Install with sudo rpm -i firezone*.rpm or sudo dpkg -i firezone*.deb depending on your distro. | Bootstrap the application with sudo firezone-ctl reconfigure. This will initialize config files, set up needed services and generate the default configuration. | Edit the default configuration located at /etc/firezone/firezone.rb. At a minimum, you’ll need to review the following configuration variables: . # Auto-generated based on the server's hostname. # Set this to the FQDN used to access the Web UI. default['firezone']['fqdn'] = 'firezone.example.com' # Specify the path to your SSL cert and private key. # If set to nil, a self-signed cert will be generated for you. default['firezone']['ssl']['certificate'] = '/path/to/cert.pem' default['firezone']['ssl']['certificate_key'] = '/path/to/key.pem' . | Reconfigure the application to pick up the new changes: sudo firezone-ctl reconfigure. | Finally, create an admin user with sudo firezone-ctl create-or-reset-admin. The login credentials will be printed to the console output. | Now you should be able to log into the web UI at the FQDN you specified in step 5 above, e.g. https://firezone.example.com | .
