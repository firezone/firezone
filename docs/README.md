## Overview

[Firezone](https://www.firezone.dev/?utm_source=readme) is an open source
platform to securely manage remote access for any-sized organization. Unlike
most VPNs, Firezone takes a granular, least-privileged approach to access
management with group-based policies that control access to individual
applications, entire subnets, and everything in between.

## Features

Firezone is:

- **Fast:** Built on WireGuard® to be
  [3-4 times](https://wireguard.com/performance/) faster than OpenVPN.
- **Scalable:** Deploy two or more gateways for automatic load balancing and
  failover.
- **Private:** Peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted tunnels prevent packets from
  routing through our infrastructure.
- **Secure:** Zero attack surface thanks to Firezone's holepunching tech which
  establishes tunnels on-the-fly at the time of access.
- **Open:** Our entire product is open-source, allowing anyone to audit the
  codebase.
- **Flexible:** Authenticate users via email, Google Workspace, Okta, Entra ID,
  or OIDC and sync users and groups automatically.
- **Simple:** Deploy gateways and configure access in minutes with a snappy
  admin UI.

Firezone is **not:**

- A tool for creating bi-directional mesh networks
- A full-featured router or firewall
- An IPSec or OpenVPN server

## Quickstart

The quickest way to get started with Firezone is to sign up for an account at

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### Can I self-host Firezone?

Our [license](#license) won't stop you from self-hosting the entire Firezone
product top to bottom, but our internal APIs are changing rapidly so we can't
meaningfully support self-hosting Firezone in production at this time.

If you're feeling especially adventurous and want to self-host Firezone for
**educational** or **hobby** purposes, follow the instructions to spin up a
local development environment in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The latest published clients (on App Stores and on
[releases](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases)) are only guaranteed
to work with the managed version of Firezone and may not work with a self-hosted
portal built from this repository. This is because Apple and Google can
sometimes delay updates to their app stores, and so the latest published version
may not be compatible with the tip of `main` from this repository.

Therefore, if you're experimenting with self-hosting Firezone, you will probably
want to use clients you build and distribute yourself as well.

See the READMEs in the following directories for more information on building
each client:

- macOS / iOS: [swift/apple](../swift/apple)
- Android / ChromeOS: [kotlin/android](../kotlin/android)
- Windows / Linux: [rust/gui-client](../rust/gui-client)

### How long will 0.7 be supported until?

**Firezone 0.7 is currently end-of-life and has stopped receiving updates as of
January 31st, 2024.** It will continue to be available indefinitely from the
`legacy` branch of this repo under the Apache 2.0 license.

### How much does it cost?

We offer flexible per-seat monthly and annual plans for the cloud-managed
version of Firezone, with optional invoicing for larger organizations. See our
[pricing](https://www.firezone.dev/pricing?utm_source=readme) page for more
details.

Those experimenting with self-hosting can use Firezone for free without feature
or seat limitations, but we can't provide support for self-hosted installations
at this time.
