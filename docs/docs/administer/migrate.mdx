title: Migrate to Docker
sidebar_position: 2
---

Chef Infra Client, the configuration system Chef Omnibus relies on, has been
[scheduled for End-of-Life in 2024](https://docs.chef.io/versions/#supported-commercial-distributions).
As such, Omnibus-based deployments
will be deprecated in a future version of Firezone.

Follow this guide to migrate from an Omnibus-based deployment to a Docker-based
deployment. In most cases this can be done with minimal downtime and without
requiring you to regenerate WireGuard configurations for each device.

Estimated time to complete: **2 hours**.

## Steps to Migrate

1. **Back up** your server. This ensure you have a working state to roll back to
in case anything goes wrong. At a _bare minimum_ you'll want to back up the
[file and directories Firezone uses
](../reference/file-and-directory-locations), but we recommend taking a full
1. Ensure you're running the latest version of Firezone (0.6.0 at the time of
this writing). See our [upgrade guide](upgrade) if not.
snapshot if possible.
1. Install the latest version of [**Docker Server**
](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server) and [Docker Compose
](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-compose)
for your distro. We highly recommend using Docker Server for Linux. Docker
Desktop will probably work too, but is discouraged at this time
because it rewrites packets under some conditions and may cause unexpected
issues with Firezone.
1. Stop Firezone:
```bash
sudo firezone-ctl stop
```
1. Download and run the migration script:
```bash
sudo -E bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/firezone/firezone/raw/master/scripts/migrate.sh)"
```
This will ask you a few questions, then attempt to migrate your installation to
Docker.
1. If all goes well, you should now be able to bring the Docker services up:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Rolling Back

If anything goes wrong, you can abort the migration by simply bring the Docker
services down and the Omnibus ones back up:

```bash
docker-compose down
sudo firezone-ctl start
```
