# Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

You have two options for activating MFA with Firezone:

1. Enable a TOTP-based second factor for the local email/password
authentication method.
1. Configure Firezone to SSO via one of our [supported identity providers
](../#integrate-an-sso-provider) and enable MFA through the identity provider.

## MFA with Firezone

Firezone currently supports using a time-based one time password
(TOTP) as an additional factor. This is supported with the local authentication
method only; for SSO authentication we recommend enabling your provider's MFA
functionality [as described below](#mfa-with-identity-provider).

Admins can visit `/settings/account/register_mfa` in the admin portal to
generate a QR code to be scanned by your authenticator app.

Unprivileged users can visit `/user_account/register_mfa` after logging into
the user portal.

## MFA with your identity provider

Most identity providers support additional authentication factors in addition to
email/password. Consult your provider's documentation to enforce an
additional factor. We have included links to a few common providers below:
