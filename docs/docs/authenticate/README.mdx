Firezone supports the following authentication methods:

1. [Local email/password (default)](local-auth)
1. [SSO authentication via OpenID Connect](oidc)
1. [SSO authentication via SAML 2.0](saml)

:::note
If your Identity Provider doesn't work with the methods listed above,
[contact us](https://www.firezone.dev/contact/sales) about custom integrations.

## Integrate an SSO Provider

We've included instructions on how to set up Firezone with several popular
identity providers using our Generic OIDC integration:

* [Okta](oidc/okta)
* [Azure Active Directory](oidc/azuread)
* [Google](oidc/google)
* [Onelogin](oidc/onelogin)
* [Zitadel](oidc/zitadel)

If your identity provider is not listed above, but has a generic OIDC or SAML
connector, please consult their documentation to find instructions on obtaining
the config settings required. Instructions for setting up Firezone with a
generic OIDC provider can be found [here](oidc).

Open a [Github issue](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues)
to request documentation or submit a pull request to add documentation for your
provider. If you require assistance in setting up your OIDC provider, please
join the [Firezone Slack group
](https://www.firezone.dev/slack).

### The OIDC Redirect URL

For each OIDC provider a corresponding URL is created for redirecting to
the configured provider's sign-in URL. The URL format is `https://firezone.example.com/auth/oidc/PROVIDER`
where `PROVIDER` is the OIDC key for that particular provider.

For example, the OIDC config below

```json
{
  "google": {
    "client_id": "...",
    "...": "..."
  },
  "okta": {
    "client_id": "...",
    "...": "..."
  }
}
```

would generate the following URLs:

* `https://firezone.example.com/auth/oidc/google`
* `https://firezone.example.com/auth/oidc/okta`

These URLs could then be distributed to end users for direct navigation to
the identity provider's login portal for authentication to Firezone.

## Enforce Periodic Re-authentication

Periodic re-authentication can be enforced by changing the setting in
`settings/security`. This can be used to ensure a user must sign in to Firezone
periodically in order to maintain their VPN session.

You can set the session length to a minimum of **1 hour** and maximum of **90 days**.
Setting this to Never disables this setting, allowing VPN sessions indefinitely.
This is the default.

### Re-authentication

To re-authenticate an expired VPN session, a user will need to turn off their
VPN session and sign in to the Firezone portal (URL specified during
[deployment](../deploy#prepare-to-deploy)).

See detailed Client Instructions on how to re-authenticate your session
[here](../user-guides/client-instructions).

#### VPN Connection Status

A user's connection status is shown on the Users page under the table column
`VPN Connection`. The connection statuses are:

* ENABLED - The connection is enabled.
* DISABLED - The connection is disabled by an administrator or OIDC refresh failure.
* EXPIRED - The connection is disabled due to authentication expiration or a user
has not signed in for the first time.
