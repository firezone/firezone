Firezone supports Single Sign-On (SSO) using Jumpcloud through the generic SAML 2.0 connector.
This guide will walk you through how to configure the integration.

## Create a SAML connector

In the Jumpcloud admin portal, create a new App under
the SSO tab. At the bottom of the popup window, click `Custom SAML App`.

After entering your desired value for `Display Label`, click the `SSO` tab,
then use the following configuration values:

| Setting                   | Value                                                                                                                                     |
| ---                       | ---                                                                                                                                       |
| IdP Entity ID             | Any unique string will work, e.g. `firezone-jumpcloud`.                                                                                   |
| SP Entity ID              | This should be the same as your Firezone `SAML_ENTITY_ID`, defaults to `urn:firezone.dev:firezone-app`.                                   |
| ACS URL                   | This is your Firezone `EXTERNAL_URL/auth/saml/sp/consume/:config_id`, e.g. `https://firezone.company.com/auth/saml/sp/consume/jumpcloud`. |
| SAMLSubject NameID        | `email`                                                                                                                                   |
| SAMLSubject NameID Format | Leave at the default.                                                                                                                     |
| Signature Algorithm       | `RSA-SHA256`                                                                                                                              |
| Sign Assertion            | **Checked**.                                                                                                                              |

Leave the rest of the settings unchanged, then click the `activate` button at the bottom-right.

Your configuration should resemble the following:

Now, download the IdP Metadata document by selecting the App you just created
and then clicking the `export metadata` button in the upper-right. You'll need
to copy-paste the contents of this document into the Firezone portal in the next step.

## Add SAML identity provider to Firezone

In the Firezone portal, add a SAML identity provider under the Security tab
by filling out the following information:

| Setting                   | Value           | Notes                                                                                                                                  |
| ---                       | ---             | ---                                                                                                                                    |
| Config ID                 | `jumpcloud`     | Firezone uses this value to construct endpoints required in the SAML authentication flow (e.g., receiving assertions, login requests). |
| Label                     | `Jumpcloud`     | Appears on the sign in button for authentication.                                                                                      |
| Base URL                  | Leave unchaged. |                                                                                                                                        |
| Metadata                  | see note        | Copy-paste the contents of the SAML metadata document you downloaded in the previous step from Jumpcloud.                              |
| Sign assertions           | Checked.        |                                                                                                                                        |
| Sign metadata             | Checked.        |                                                                                                                                        |
| Require signed assertions | Checked.        |                                                                                                                                        |
| Required signed envelopes | **Unchecked.**  |                                                                                                                                        |

Your SAML configuration should resemble the following screenshot:

After saving the SAML config, you should see a `Sign in with Jumpcloud` button
in your Firezone portal.
