# Security considerations

**Disclaimer**: Firezone is still beta software. The codebase has not yet
received a formal security audit. For highly sensitive and mission-critical
production deployments, we recommend disabling local authentication as
detailed [below](#production-deployments).

## List of services and ports

Shown below is a table of default ports used by Firezone services.

## Production deployments

For production deployments of Firezone, we recommend you disable local authentication
altogether by setting `default['firezone']['authentication']['local']['enabled'] = false`
(Omnibus-based deployments) or `LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED=false` (Docker-based deployments).
Local authentication can also be disabled on the `/settings/security` page.

:::caution
Ensure you've set up a working [OIDC](/authenticate/oidc/) or [SAML](/authenticate/saml/)-based
authentication provider before disabling the local authentication method.
