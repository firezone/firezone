# Set up IP-based split tunneling with Firezone

This guide will describe the steps required to enable split tunneling with
WireGuard using Firezone so only traffic to defined IP ranges will be routed
through the VPN.

Firezone sets the `Allowed IPs` field so traffic destined for
specific IPs are encrypted and routed through the gateway.

## Step 1: Set AllowedIPs

AllowedIPs can be set globally on the `/settings/default` page or individually
for each device during creation. Changes will only apply to new WireGuard
tunnel configurations generated by Firezone.

Some examples of values in this field are:

- `0.0.0.0/0, ::/0` - all network traffic will be routed to the VPN server.
- `192.0.2.3/32` - only traffic to a single IP address
will be routed to the VPN server.
- `3.5.140.0/22` - only traffic to IPs in the `3.5.140.1 - 3.5.143.254` range
will be routed to the VPN server.
In this example, the CIDR range for the `ap-northeast-2` AWS region was used.

:::note
When deciding where to route a packet, Firezone chooses the egress
interface corresponding to the most specific route first.

## Step 2: Set the DNS server(s) (optional)

You can define the DNS server(s) used by devices when the WireGuard tunnel
is active. By default, it uses Cloudflare's DNS servers (`1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1`).
Visit the `/settings/default` page to override this value.

For split tunneling, this may be desired if you run a DNS server that
resolves internal hosts to private IPs reachable via Firezone.

:::note
If you wish to resolve DNS queries
over the encrypted VPN tunnel (recommended), ensure the DNS IPs are included in `AllowedIPs`.

## Step 3: Regenerate the device configurations

Changes made to global settings in the **Defaults** tab are only applied to
future device configurations generated by Firezone.

Users need to regenerate device configurations to update existing devices
for the updated configuration changes to `AllowedIPs` and `DNS`.

See [add device](/user-guides/add-devices/) for instructions.
