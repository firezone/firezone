Firezone provides the ability to require authentication to establish VPN connections.

## Web Authentication (default)

Firezone will use the user's email address and password
to authenticate their VPN session.
You can set the session length to a minimum of 1 hour andmaximum of 90 days.
Setting this to Never disables this setting allows VPN sessions indefinitely.
This is the default.
