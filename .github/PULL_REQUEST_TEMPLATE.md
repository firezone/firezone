<!--
How to write a good PR description:

- Summarize WHAT this PR does and WHY it's needed.
- Call out any notable design decisions, trade-offs, or alternatives considered.
- Mention how it was tested: manual steps, new/updated tests, CI checks, etc.
- Link related issues with "Fixes #123", "Closes #123", or "Resolves #123".
- Keep it concise — a few sentences is often enough for small changes.
