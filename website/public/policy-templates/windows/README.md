# Windows policy templates

These policy templates can be imported into Intune here:
https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesWindowsMenu/~/configuration

Intune only allows a single policy template per namespace to be active at any
one time. Therefore, in order to upload (and test) a new template, you need to
delete the previous one. The menu for deleting an uploaded ADMX file is hidden
behind the three dots at the end of the row.
