# Windows policy templates

These policy templates can be imported into Intune here: https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesWindowsMenu/~/configuration

Intune only allows a single policy template per namespace to be active at any one time.
Therefore, in order to upload (and test) a new template, you need to delete the previous one.
The menu for deleting an uploaded ADMX file is hidden behind the three dots at the end of the row.
