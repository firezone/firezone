<span className="font-semibold">Firezone comes from humble roots.</span>

It was born out of necessity -- as an engineer at Cisco I found myself in need
of an easy way to deploy and manage a VPN server for security automation. I had
used OpenVPN in the past and loathed it, so this time I decided to try a fast,
new contender called [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com).

While WireGuard itself is a marvelous feat of engineering, it provides only
basic building blocks. Users wishing to deploy WireGuard as a replacement for
their existing remote access VPN will find themselves building automation to
distribute keys, manage users, configure routing tables, and so on.

And I found myself doing just that. It wasn't particularly difficult automation
to build, but it was tedious and error-prone. Although the benefits of WireGuard
were worth the price of admission, colleagues and I agreed -- _wouldn't it be
great if a tool existed to do this for us?_

So after one particularly grueling refactoring project involving a major
dependency in an ancient codebase that had become "suddenly" deprecated, I
decided it was time for something new. I resigned, picked up a book on
Elixir/Phoenix, and, rejoicing at the opportunity to learn some new tech,
started building what became the first version of Firezone.

When we [launched on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28683231)
nearly two years ago, we never envisioned Firezone to be more than a simple tool
for deploying your own WireGuard-based VPN server.

Fast-forward
[4,500 GitHub stars](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/stargazers), a
[Y Combinator backed funding round](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/30/ycombinator-open-source-startups-winter-22-demo-day/),
and [130 releases](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases) later --
Firezone has now grown into something more.

We now count over <strong>3,000</strong> Firezone instances running in the wild
(possibly much more -- we allow users to
[disable telemetry](/docs/reference/telemetry)) securing private networks for
hobbyists, schools, non-profits, and businesses with hundreds of employees.

To be clear, Firezone is successful in large part because WireGuard itself is
successful. In an industry brimming with enterprise security bloatware and
acronyms galore, WireGuard's a breath of fresh air. It's almost boring how well
it works. I suppose I could go on and on about WireGuard's strengths, but I
won't. After all, this post is supposed to be about Firezone 1.0.

So let's back up -- what is a VPN anyway, and why is one needed at all? To
answer that we'll need to go back in time to the formation of the early
Internet.

#### The purpose of a VPN

You see, the early Internet had only a handful of entities connected to it --
connecting to the Internet was expensive, after all. Typically only banks,
universities, and other large institutions could justify the cost.

So when you connected your organization to the Internet and began receiving
packets, it was clear which entity it was from based on its allocated IPv4
address range. Since there were so few entities connected, you could easily know
who you were communicating with, and who to contact (and blame) in case any
issues arose.

But as access to the Internet became cheaper, more types of entities could
afford to connect. As more entities connected, the number of resources on the
Internet grew, and its
[value increased quadratically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law).
Soon, all types of entities wanted to connect -- local governments, schools,
small businesses. Internet Service Providers began offering connections to mere
individuals. Eventually there were so many entities on the Internet that
identifying who you were communicating with was no longer trivial. Since you
couldn't easily know who you were talking to, you couldn't always trust them to
behave.

And thus, firewalls were born. Firewalls keep packets of information out from
entities you don't wish to communicate with and let packets in from those you
do.

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="/images/firewall-block.svg">
  <Image

    height={400}
    src="/images/firewall-block.svg"
    alt="firewall animation"
    className="mx-auto"
  />
</object>

And this worked well for some time. However, the Internet grew even larger (as
networks tend to do). And then a problem arose: firewalls required you to know
_in advance_ who you'd like to communicate with, adding them to your
configuration, and likewise removing the ones you didn't. As you might imagine,
it quickly became unwieldy to keep these configurations up to date.

So a clever solution was developed: what if you could dynamically add and remove
entities to the firewall configuration, on the fly?

And thus stateful firewalls were born. I should pause here and clarify that
stateful firewalls are sometimes confused with
[Network Address Translation (NAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation),
since they're often found on the same device. But there's an important
distinction: A stateful firewall _remembers_ stuff it's seen in order to to
update its configuration dynamically, whereas a NAT device is primarily
concerned with static operation.

Stateful firewalls exist in nearly every consumer router and datacenter gateway
connected to the Internet today. There's a very high likelihood the Internet
connection you're reading this from is behind one or several of them. They've
been largely successful at serving their intended purpose.

    height={400}
    src="/images/stateful-firewall.svg"
    alt="firewall animation"
    className="mx-auto"
  />
</object>

But this post wouldn't be very interesting if we stopped there.

You see, there's still one fundamental problem with stateful firewalls,
particularly as it relates to remote access. For two-way communication to occur,
one entity (namely the one "behind" the firewall) must always initiate. This
means that entities outside the firewall can never communicate to those inside,
_even if the outside entities are trusted_. To do that, you'd have to add a
configuration rule to expect an outside entity to talk in, which means we're
back to managing firewall configurations again.

This is where VPNs come in. A VPN _disguises_ an outside entity as an inside
one, thereby allowing communication by default.

After the firewall authenticates the outside entity, they both agree to package
up the information packets between each other so that the Internet routers in
between forward them properly. This creates a kind of network within a network:
the original packets with their network attributes are packaged into another
packet with more network attributes, thus giving this technology its name:
Virtual Private Network.

So a VPN is just a technology that authenticates an outside, untrusted entity to
a protected network. And WireGuard is the best VPN technology we have so far. As
far as VPNs go, there's nothing faster, more secure, or more robust.

#### The challenge with trust

But there's a security risk with this arrangement: once the outsider is
authenticated, all of the entities inside the firewall perimeter now trust its
packets completely. What if an untrusted entity managed to obtain a VPN
connection? One misconfiguration, stolen credential, or hijacked connection
would result in a perimeter breach. Not good.

The solution to this problem is aptly named
[Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model).
The idea with ZTA is to do away with using network zone (or perceived network
zone in the case of a VPN) for determining whether to trust communication. All
network zones are considered _untrusted_ by default. Suddenly the network
perimeter we had before vanishes -- inside and outside entities are equally
untrusted.

Then how does an entity come to be trusted? We still authenticate them as usual,
but there's a key difference: with ZTA, we authenticate entities each time the
communication is requested, on the fly. Not once at the perimeter. And since the
perimeter is gone, the protected entity itself (or a proxy) authenticates the
untrusted entity. But wait, hold on a minute -- what happened to the firewall?

This presents a dilemma. If we use a firewall to protect entities, they're
shielded outside the perimeter, but left unprotected inside the perimeter. And
if we choose ZTA, we only trust entities we've authenticated directly, but must
expose ourselves to _all_ outside entities in order to do so.

#### The solution

Firezone solves this problem with a third entity, called an access broker, which
works as follows:

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="/images/firezone-1.0.svg">
  <Image
    width={600}
    height={600}
    src="/images/firezone-1.0.svg"
    alt="firewall animation"
    className="mx-auto"
  />
</object>

1. The protected entity is deployed behind a stateful firewall.
1. The protected entity then initiates and maintains a bi-directional control
   channel to the broker.
1. Whenever an untrusted entity wants access to the protected resource, it
   notifies the broker.
1. If the broker determines access is granted, it notifies the protected entity
   that the now-trusted entity is allowed in.
1. The protected entity then initiates communication to the now-trusted entity
   _directly_. The stateful firewall's configuration is dynamically updated,
   allowing communication to happen from the now-trusted entity to the protected
   entity.

So we're able to both authenticate the untrusted entity at the time of request,
yet also keep our protected entity behind a firewall to keep it invisible to the
public Internet. In fact, _both_ entities can live behind a stateful firewall
and this technique would still work -- the principles are the same.

As it turns out, this approach is
[nothing new](https://bford.info/pub/net/p2pnat/). It's how web browsers and
VoIP systems have established peer to peer connections for low-latency audio and
video chat [for over a decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC).

Firezone 1.0 not only makes this process seamless for connectivity, but also
goes one step further by exposing granular controls to allow or deny access
based on attributes like which group a user is a member of and so on.

Of course if you wanted to use Firezone 1.0 like a traditional perimeter-based
VPN and then transition to finer-grained access controls over time, you can do
that as well. We understand the realities of legacy processes and systems, so we
designed 1.0 to be flexible enough to suit the needs of both.

While we were at it, we decided to build a slew of new features for 1.0 in
addition to the architecture improvements laid out in this post. Most notably, a
cloud-managed admin portal, native clients, and high availability support. But
there's much more. Check our
[product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/firezone/projects/9) for more details
on what's coming in 1.0.

#### Next steps

To help ensure a bug-free experience for our users, we'll be rolling out 1.0 in
phases, starting with an early access preview aiming to launch mid-Q3 of this
year. If you're interesting in joining the early access program,
