We will be performing scheduled maintenance on **Sunday, December 7, 2025 from 04:00 to 06:00 UTC** to roll out major improvements to authentication, directory sync, and user and group management.

## What to expect

- **Authentication**: New authentication requests may not work during the maintenance period
- **New connections**: New connections to Resources may not work during maintenance
- **Existing connections**: Existing connections to Resources should be minimally impacted

## What we're improving

This maintenance will deliver major enhancements to:

- **Authentication**: New session management features and simplified management experience
