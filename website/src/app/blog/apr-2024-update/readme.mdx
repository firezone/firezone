### Firezone 1.0 GA

After months of beta testing with our early adopters, today we're announcing
that Firezone 1.0 is now generally available. We couldn't be more excited for
you to try it.

[Sign up now](https://app.firezone.dev/sign_up) to get started.

#### The road to 1.0

This release marks a significant milestone for Firezone.

When we [announced](/blog/firezone-1-0) Firezone 1.0 was coming last July, we
knew we had our work cut out for us. Until that point, Firezone was a simple web
app into a single Docker image. Although a great fit for homelabbers and small
groups, it wasn't suited to address the remote access needs of larger
organizations.

It was easy to get up and running quickly with Firezone, but as the number of
users, devices, and networks to protect grew within an organization, so did the
complexity of managing it all.

So we went back to the whiteboard to reimagine how Firezone would look if we
rebuilt it from the ground up The Right Way™ -- with scalability and ease of
use in mind.

    We don't always work together IRL, but when we do, we rearchitect
    everything.
  </span>
</div>)}

We spent the next several months prototyping, testing, and iterating on a new
architecture that would allow Firezone to scale to hundreds of thousands of
users and millions of devices.

#### The stack

We weren't going to squander a good opportunity to rethink our stack choice, but
it remained largely the same: the new Firezone would be built with Elixir for
the control plane and Rust for the data plane.

Why?

Elixir has been getting lots of acclaim in recent years for its concurrency
model and fault-tolerance features. And for good reason: it runs on Erlang's
BEAM VM, the same technology that powers the telecom industry's most reliable
systems. There's a good chance the device you're reading this on has an IP
address handed out by an Erlang-powered telecom switch.

As it turns out, managing connections for a remote access product is _a lot_
like managing messages across a telecom network:

```text
1. Peer A wants to connect to Peer B.
2. Is it allowed?
  Yes: here are their addresses and keys to secure the connection.
  No: drop the connection.
```

And Elixir's concurrency model makes it easy to manage thousands of these
connection "intents" on very little hardware -- just a few tiny VMs orchestrate
all connections across all our customers, globally.

And what about the data plane? For that, we turned to Rust.

Rust forms the network backbone of Firezone, handling all the heavy lifting of
encrypting and decrypting packets as they flow between Clients and Gateways. As
far as systems languages go, Rust couldn't be a better fit for the job. Its
memory safety guarantees eliminate entire classes of bugs that plague other
systems languages, making it a great choice for a security-critical application
like Firezone.

And it has build targets for just about every platform under the sun. Our
[core connectivity library](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/tree/main/rust/libs/connlib),
for example, runs reliably on iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS.

We'll be sharing more about our stack choices in future blog posts, but suffice
to say, we're very happy with the results so far.

### What's unique about Firezone?

There are a lot of remote access solutions out there, so what makes Firezone
different?

For starters, Firezone uses [WireGuard®](https://www.wireguard.com/) under the
hood -- a new VPN protocol that's
[faster](https://www.wireguard.com/performance) and
[more secure](https://www.wireguard.com/formal-verification/) than traditional
VPNs. But that's just the start.

We learned from Firezone 0.x that organizations grappling with remote access at
scale needed things like integrations with identity providers that keep
directory information in sync, high availability features, and an easier way to
manage access policies that don't require a PhD in network security.

Firezone 1.0 delivers on all of that and more.

#### Core concepts in 1.0

Before we dive into the new features, let's first cover some core concepts new
to Firezone:

- **Resource**: A [Resource](/kb/deploy/resources) is any DNS name, IP, or
  network (CIDR range) you wish to manage access for. DNS-based Resources can be
  used to manage access to internal or external applications and optionally be
  configured to match all subdomains as well. CIDR-based Resources can be used
  to manage access for an entire subnets, similar to a traditional VPN.
- **Gateway**: [Gateways](/kb/deploy/gateways) are Firezone servers that run on
  your infrastructure. Gateways must be defined within a Site, and any traffic
  to/from Resources associated with a Site will pass through one of that Site’s
  Gateways. Gateways are designed to be lightweight and don't require persistent
  storage to function.
- **Site**: [Sites](/kb/deploy/sites) are user-created environments where admins
  can manage Resources and the Gateways that enable access to those Resources. A
  typical Site name might be `SJC lab 1`, `Chicago office`, or
  `Testbench subnet`. All Gateways and Resources in a Site are assumed to be
  able to reach each other in a shared network context such as a VPC or LAN.

For a more detailed overview of these concepts, check out the
[FAQ](/kb/reference/faq) and [glossary](/kb/reference/glossary) sections of our
documentation.

#### High availability

The first major feature in 1.0 we should discuss is high availability. Firezone
achieves high availability by allowing you to deploy multiple Gateways within a
given Site.

Each Firezone Gateway is a tiny, self-contained binary that needs
[only a single environment](/kb/deploy/gateways) variable to function. Throw it
in a VM, a container, or on an IoT device -- it's lightweight enough to run
everywhere. Its sole purpose is to shuttle encrypted packets between Clients and
Resources.

After you [create a Site](/kb/deploy/sites), you can deploy as many Gateways
into that Site as you'd like. All Gateways in the Site will work in unison to
provide load balancing and automatic failover for all connections to Resources
in the Site.

If a Gateway goes offline or becomes overloaded, any Clients connected to it
will automatically migrate their connections to a healthy Gateway in the Site.
This process is completely transparent to the user and happens in most cases
within a few seconds.

Armed with this ability, admins can now enjoy a simple maintenance process: (1)
take a Gateway down, (2) upgrade it, and (3) bring it back up. _That's it_. No
more lengthy maintenance windows, backing up configurations, or worrying about
extended downtime.

A nice side effect of this architecture is that it provides near infinite
horizontal scalability, which works as follows:

When a Client wants to connect to a protected resource, it sends a connection
intent message to the control plane API. If the intent is approved, the control
plane responds with a healthy Gateway to connect to. If there are multiple
healthy Gateways, the control plane will round-robin between them, effectively
splitting the load across all Gateways in the Site.

Need more throughput? Simple: deploy more Gateways. The control plane will
automatically distribute the load across all of them.

We think high availability is such a core feature in a remote access solution
that we made failover and load balancing available **on all plans**, including
the Starter tier. [Read more](/kb/deploy/gateways) about how it works in our
documentation.

#### Firewall hole-punching

You know what's not fun? Configuring firewalls.

More precisely, configuring your organization's cloud or corporate firewalls to
allow incoming connections from the internet. Not only is it a pain to manage at
scale, it also exposes your organization to all kinds of security risks.

So we rearchitected Firezone to include the same NAT traversal techniques that
WebRTC applications have enjoyed for years now:
[STUN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8489.html) and
[TURN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8553), known collectively as
[ICE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8445).

As you can probably surmise from the above links, these are well-established
standards for doing reliable NAT traversal. These have been battle-tested in the
field for years across all kinds of products -- Firezone is only the latest to
benefit from them.

What does this mean for you? It means you can deploy Firezone without touching a
single firewall configuration and still enjoy the same level of performance as
if you did. Attack surface is minimized and connections are direct. It's a
win-win.

For the curious readers, you can find our implementation of ICE, aptly named
"snownet", in our repository
[here](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/tree/main/rust/libs/connlib/snownet).

#### Directory sync

The last feature we want to highlight in this announcement is directory sync.
Firezone currently supports directory sync for [Okta](https://www.okta.com/),
[Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra), and
[Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/), with more providers on the
way.

Anyone who's ever managed a large organization knows the pain of keeping user
and group information in sync across multiple systems. It's a nightmare to
manage manually. And it's error-prone, leading to security risks and compliance
issues.

Experienced admins will now be thinking, "But what about
[SCIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644)? Doesn't that make this
easy?". Sadly, SCIM today is one of those standards that isn't. Entire
[business models](https://www.workos.com) have been optimized to leverage
inconsistencies in SCIM implementations across different identity providers.

So Firezone doesn't use SCIM. Instead, we
built our very own directory sync engine
that can be extended to virtually any source of identity data, regardless of
whether they support SCIM. If it has a REST API, we can probably sync with it.

Directory sync is available only for the Enterprise plan so we can be sure it'll
work reliably for your organization.
