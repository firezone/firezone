In the early morning hours of November 28, 2025 (UTC), we experienced a limited PII exposure affecting a small number of users. The issue **has been resolved**, and this post-mortem explains what happened, what data was involved, how we responded, and what we're changing to make sure this can't happen again.

We want to be upfront here: this was **not a product security breach or unauthorized access to our systems**. It was an email routing / mailing-list configuration mistake on our side — but even so, we understand that any exposure of personal information is serious, and we’re sorry this happened.

## What happened

Between **18:30 on November 27, 2025** and **06:15 on November 28, 2025 (UTC)**, an internal mailing-list misconfiguration caused three automated account deletion request emails to be delivered to administrators of other Firezone accounts.

Those emails contained limited PII and account metadata: **user names, email addresses, account names, account slugs, and account IDs.**

## Impact

A total of **three (3) accounts** were affected. The information was visible only to unintended **account administrators** who received the emails during the brief window of misconfiguration — it was not publicly exposed.

We have:

- deleted all account data for the three affected users as per their deletion requests,
- contacted each affected user directly to explain what happened,
- asked all unintended recipients to permanently delete the emails, and
- confirmed the alias is now routing only to the intended support recipients.

## How this happened

The issue was caused by a misconfiguration of our **admin-announce** mailing list in Mailgun. This list is used to send service-related emails to Firezone account administrators.

The list was meant to:

- send from `support@firezone.dev` so admins could reply directly to our support team, and
- deliver only to the intended admin recipients for announcements.

However, during the change, the mailing list’s **to/identifier address** was incorrectly set to `support@firezone.dev` as well. Because of how Mailgun mailing lists behave, authenticated system emails sent to that address were then broadcast to **all members of the admin-announce list**, rather than solely to support.

This was a configuration error introduced during a manual step. We corrected it immediately after detection and verified normal routing.

## Next steps

We take privacy seriously, and we’re making the following concrete changes based on this incident.

1. **Remove PII from automated support communications.**
   We’re updating our backend automation so that deletion-request and other support-triggered emails contain **no PII**. Any personal details needed for support will be accessed only through authenticated internal tools.
1. **Re-assess our email service provider safeguards.**
   While the root cause was a Firezone-side configuration mistake, we’re evaluating whether other providers offer stronger guardrails for high-impact mailing lists and alias routing. If better safeguards exist, we want them.
1. **Fully automate admin announcement workflows.**
   This incident depended on a manual step during routine prep work. We’ll be reducing or eliminating manual alias/list edits in favor of automated, reviewed workflows, so we don’t rely on human memory for critical routing.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this incident, please do not hesitate to [reach out to our support team](/support) directly.
