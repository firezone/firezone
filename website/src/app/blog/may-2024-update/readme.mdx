### Traffic restrictions

At Firezone our mission is to improve your organization's security. You've
already been able to define Group-based access policies to restrict access to a
particular host, but we've taken this a step further. You can now add port and
protocol (ICMP, UDP, and TCP currently supported) restrictions on each Resource
to define even more granular access controls.

Simply add the desired filters when creating or editing a Resource, and only
that type of traffic will be allowed. This is useful for allowing access to some
services running on a host but not all of them.

#### How it works

When you add traffic restrictions to a Resource, all Gateways that can serve
that Resource will immediately receive the updated Resource configuration.

Restrictions are enforced at the **Gateway** level. If a user tries to access a
service on the host not allowed by the restriction, the Gateway will simply drop
the traffic, preventing it from ever reaching the service in question.

Traffic restrictions are supported on all Resource types, including DNS, IP, and
CIDR-based Resources with **Gateway version 1.0.3** and higher, and can be
enabled on the Team and Enterprise plans.

### Blog: How DNS works in Firezone

Firezone's approach to DNS works a bit differently than one might expect. One
question we get a lot is, "why do my DNS Resources resolve to different IPs with
Firezone enabled?". Great question! We've written an in-depth explanation of
this in [this blog post](/blog/how-dns-works-in-firezone).

So if you've ever wondered why your DNS Resources resolve to different IPs with
Firezone enabled, or if you're just curious about how DNS works in Firezone, go
read the post!

### Connectivity and reliability improvements

Last but not least, we've made several improvements to the way Firezone Clients
stay connected to Gateways, even when switching WiFi networks or moving between
cellular, WiFi, and ethernet connections.

Connections were already quite stable before, but could take a few seconds to
resume when switching networks. We've made several improvements to the way
Clients handle network changes to improve reconnection times considerably, to
the point where you shouldn't notice any interruption at all.

We also added more Points of Presence (PoPs) in several regions to improve
latency and reliability for users in those areas. See our updated
[PoP list](/kb/architecture/tech-stack#regional-availability) for more details
on where Firezone's Relay and control plane servers are available.
