# Architecture: Tech Stack

Firezone has a unique mix of data throughput, reliability, and scability
requirements. So we made sure to pick the right tools for the job. Here's a
high-level overview of the tech stack choices we made and why.

## Control plane

The control plane, which includes the
[admin portal](/kb/architecture/core-components#admin-portal),
[control plane API](/kb/architecture/core-components#control-plane-api), and
[Policy Engine](/kb/architecture/core-components#policy-engine), is built using
Elixir and Phoenix.

[Elixir](https://www.elixir-lang.org) is a functional programming language
that's received lots of attention in recent years for its performance and
concurrency properties.

It's built on top of the [Erlang VM](https://www.erlang.org/), which has a
reputation for being fault-tolerant and highly concurrent. Erlang continues to
power some of the world's most reliable systems, including a wide variety of
telecom equipment and messaging platforms like WhatsApp.

Together, these technologies power Firezone's realtime control plane API,
allowing it to reliably handle thousands of policy decisions per second.

## Data plane

The data plane, which includes the Clients, Gateway, and Relay, is built using
Rust.

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is a systems programming language that's known
for its performance and safety. Not only do its memory safety guarantees prevent
entire categories of security vulnerabilities, but it also has an outstanding
[ecosystem](https://www.crates.io) of libraries and tools that make it a great
choice for building performant network applications.

### Client architecture

Some parts of the macOS, iOS, and Android applications can't be built in Rust,
and so a foreign function interface (FFI) is used to call into either Swift or
Kotlin code appropriately. In general, we strive to keep the FFI architecture as
simple as possible, leaving Rust-land only when absolutely required.

Internally, the Clients maintain two primary types of state:

- Control plane event loop
- Data plane state machine

These manage the control path and hot paths of the Client, respectively. They
interact through a thin software layer to exchange WireGuard keys and STUN
information between the control plane API and the TUN interface.

  For a deep dive into Firezone's data plane architecture and its sans-IO
  design, we recommend reading [sans-IO: The secret to effective Rust for
  network services](/blog/sans-io).

Here's a high-level diagram of the various software components used in the
Client applications:

The separation between control plane and data plane state serves two functions:

- It ensures that control plane messages do not slow down or otherwise block the
  data plane processing loop.
- It allows the Client to withstand temporary network partitions from the
  control plane API without dropping data plane packets. This means, for
  example, existing connections to Resources continue to operate uninterrupted
  even as we deploy new versions of the control plane API.

## Ops and infrastructure

Firezone uses the following tools for ops and infrastructure:

| Category                      | Tool/Service                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Cloud provider: Control plane | Google Cloud Platform         |
| Cloud provider: Relays        | Microsoft Azure               |
| Source code management        | GitHub                        |
| CI/CD                         | GitHub Actions                |
| Monitoring and alerting       | Sentry                        |
| Logging                       | Sentry                        |
| Persistence store             | Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) |
| Infrastructure as code        | Terraform                     |

### Regional availability

Firezone Relays are deployed globally to ensure low-latency fallback paths for
cases where direct peer-to-peer connections aren't possible. Relays are deployed
in the following Azure regions:

| City         | Region               |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| Auckland     | New Zealand North    |
| Dubai        | UAE North            |
| Doha         | Qatar Central        |
| Frankfurt    | Germany West Central |
| Gävle        | Sweden Central       |
| Hong Kong    | East Asia            |
| Illinois     | North Central US     |
| Iowa         | Central US           |
| Ireland      | North Europe         |

| Johannesburg | South Africa North   |
| Kuala Lumpur | Malaysia West        |
| London       | UK South             |
