# Architecture: Tech Stack

Firezone has a unique mix of data throughput, reliability, and scability
challenges. So we made sure to pick the right tools for the job. Here's a
high-level overview of the tech stack choices we made and why.

## Control plane

The control plane, which includes the
[admin portal](/kb/architecture/core-components#admin-portal),
[control plane API](/kb/architecture/core-components#control-plane-api), and
[Policy Engine](/kb/architecture/core-components#policy-engine), is built using
Elixir and Phoenix.

[Elixir](https://www.elixir-lang.org) is a functional programming language
that's received lots of attention in recent years for its performance and
scalability.

It's built on top of the [Erlang VM](https://www.erlang.org/), which has a
reputation for being fault-tolerant and highly concurrent. Erlang continues to
power some of the world's most reliable systems, including a wide variety of
telecom equipment and messaging platforms like WhatsApp.

Together, these technologies power Firezone's realtime control plane API,
allowing it to reliably handle thousands of policy decisions per second.

## Data plane

The data plane, which includes the Clients, Gateway, and Relay, is built using
Rust.

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is a systems programming language that's known
for its performance and safety. Not only do its memory safety guarantees prevent
entire categories of security vulnerabilities, but it also has an outstanding
[ecosystem](https://www.crates.io) of libraries and tools that make it a great
choice for building performant network applications.

### Client architecture

Some parts of the macOS, iOS, and Android applications can't be built in Rust,
and so a foreign function interface (FFI) is used to call into either Swift or
Kotlin code appropriately. In general, we strive to keep the FFI architecture as
simple as possible, leaving Rust-land only when absolutely required.

Internally, the Clients maintain two primary types of state:

- Control plane event loop
- Data plane state machine

These manage the control path and hot paths of the Client, respectively. They
interact through a thin software layer to exchange WireGuard keys and STUN
information between the control plane API and the TUN interface.

Here's a high-level diagram of the various software components used in the
Client applications:

## Ops and infrastructure

Firezone uses the following tools for ops and infrastructure:

| Category                | Tool/Service                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Cloud provider          | Google Cloud Platform         |
| Source code management  | GitHub                        |
| CI/CD                   | GitHub Actions                |
| Monitoring and alerting | Google Cloud Monitoring       |
| Logging                 | Google Cloud Logging          |
| Persistence store       | Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) |
| Infrastructure as code  | Terraform                     |

### Regional availability

The Firezone-managed components are deployed globally across the following GCP
zones for load balancing and latency optimization:

| City                          | Region                 | Zones                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Changhua, Taiwan              | `asia-east1`           | `asia-east1-a`           |
| Mumbai, India                 | `asia-south1`          | `asia-south1-a`          |
| Sydney, Australia             | `australia-southeast1` | `australia-southeast1-a` |
| Warsaw, Poland                | `europe-central2`      | `europe-central2-c`      |
| Hamina, Finland               | `europe-north1`        | `europe-north1-c`        |
| Saint-Ghislain, Belgium       | `europe-west1`         | `europe-west1-d`         |
| London, UK                    | `europe-west2`         | `europe-west2-c`         |
| São Paulo, Brazil             | `southamerica-east1`   | `southamerica-east1-b`   |
| Council Bluffs, Iowa          | `us-central1`          | `us-central1-b`          |
| Moncks Corner, South Carolina | `us-east1`             | `us-east1-d`             |
| Los Angeles, California       | `us-west2`             | `us-west2-b`             |
