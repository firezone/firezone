# Architecture: Critical Sequences

Firezone is a distributed system with many moving parts, but some parts are
especially critical to the integrity of the entire system:

- [Authentication](#authentication): User authentication, usually with an
  identity provider.
- [Policy evaluation](#policy-evaluation): Deciding whether to allow or deny a
  connection request.
- [DNS resolution](#dns-resolution): Resolving DNS-based Resources.
- [High availability](#high-availability): How Firezone achieves high
  availability through load balancing and automatic failover.

These will be explained in more detail below.

## Authentication

Firezone authenticates users using two primary methods:

- [Email (OTP)](/kb/authenticate/email): Users receive a one-time password (OTP)
  via email.
- [OpenID Connect](/kb/authenticate/oidc): Users authenticate with an identity
  provider that supports
  [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/).

The authentication process for each is similar. Both methods begin the
authentication process at your Firezone account's sign in page:
`https://app.firezone.dev/<your-account>`.

However, the OIDC flow redirects the user to the identity provider for
authentication before the final redirect back to Firezone.

Here's how the authentication flow works:

1. User clicks `Sign in` from the Client.
1. The Client generates random 32-byte `state` and `nonce` values. These are
   used to prevent certain kinds of forgery and injection attacks.
1. A browser window opens to your account's sign in page,
   `https://app.firezone.dev/<your-account>` containing the `nonce` and `state`
   parameters.
1. The user chooses which authentication method to use. If OIDC, the user is
   redirected out to the identity provider.
1. After successfully authenticating, the user is redirected back to the admin
   portal.
1. The admin portal mints a Firezone `token` created from the `nonce` parameter
   and other information.
1. The admin portal issues a final redirect to
   `firezone-fd0020211111://handle_client_sign_in_callback` with the `token` and
   `state` parameters from the initial request.
1. The Client receives this callback URL and validates the `state` parameter
   matches what it originally sent. This prevents other applications from
   injecting tokens into the Client's callback handler.
1. The Client saves this `token` in a platform-specific secure storage
   mechanism, for example Keychain on macOS and iOS.
1. The Client now has a valid `token` and uses it to authenticate with the
   control plane API.
1. The authentication process is complete.

## Policy evaluation

Policy evaluation is the process the
[Policy Engine](/kb/architecture/core-components#policy-engine) uses to decide
whether to allow or deny a connection request from a Client to a Resource.

If the request is allowed, connection setup information is sent to the Client
and the appropriate Gateway. If the request is denied, it's logged and then
dropped. This ensures that Clients are only connected to Gateways that are
serving Resources the User is allowed to access.

<Alert color="info">
  Connections in Firezone are **always** default-deny. Policies must be created
  to allow access.
</Alert>

Here's how the process works:

    src="/images/kb/architecture/critical-sequences/policy-evaluation.svg"

    width={1200}
    height={1200}

</Link>

1. The User attempts to access a Resource, e.g. `10.10.10.10`.
1. The Client sees the request and opens a connection request to the Policy
   Engine.
1. The Policy Engine evaluates the request against the configured Policies in
   your account based on factors such as the Groups the user is a part of, which
   Resource is being accessed, and so forth. If a match is found, the connection
   is allowed. If no match is found, the connection is dropped.
1. If the connection is allowed, the Policy Engine sends the Client the
   WireGuard keys and NAT traversal information for the Gateway that will serve
   the Resource.
1. The Policy Engine sends similar details to the Gateway.
1. The Client and Gateway establish a WireGuard tunnel, and the Gateway sets up
   a forwarding rule to the Resource.
1. Connection setup is complete. The User can now access the Resource.

Since the Client only receives WireGuard keys and NAT traversal information when
a connection is allowed, **it's not possible** for a Client to exchange packets
with the Gateway until explicitly allowed by the Policy Engine.

This means **Gateways remain invisible to the outside world**, helping to
protect against classes of attacks that perimeter-based models may be
susceptible to, such as DDoS attacks.

## DNS resolution

Secure DNS resolution is a critical function in most organizations.

Firezone employs a unique, granular approach to split DNS to ensure traffic
intended **only** for DNS-based Resources is routed through Firezone, leaving
other traffic untouched -- even when resolved IP addresses overlap.

To achieve this, Firezone embeds a tiny, in-memory DNS resolver in each Client
that intercepts all DNS queries on the system.

When the resolver sees a query that doesn't match a known Resource, it operates
in pass-through mode, forwarding the the query to the system's default resolvers
or [configured upstream resolvers](/kb/deploy/dns) in your account.

If the query matches a Resource, however, the following happens:

1. The resolver generates a special, internal IP from the range `100.96.0.0/11`
   or `fd00:2021:1111:8000::/107` and stores an internal mapping of this IP to
   the DNS name originally queried. The IP is returned to the application that
   made the query.
1. When the Client sees traffic for the IP, it triggers connection setup. The
   Client sends a request to the Policy Engine for evaluation. If the request is
   allowed, the Policy Engine finds an appropriate Gateway to route the traffic.
1. If the Policy Engine approves the Client's request, it sends the Client the
   WireGuard keys and NAT traversal information for the Gateway that will serve
   the Resource.
1. Once the connection is established (and every time an application re-queries
   a DNS name), the Client sends a message using Firezone's p2p control protocol
   to the Gateway, triggering a DNS query using the Gateway's system resolver
   for the DNS name. The result of this DNS query is stored on the Gateway in a
   lookup table and cached for 30 seconds.
1. Traffic from the application flows, and the Gateway translates the internal
   IP back to the actual IP address of the Resource, forwarding the traffic
   accordingly.

This is why you'll see DNS-based Resources resolve to IPs such as `100.96.0.1`
while the Client is signed in:

```text
> nslookup github.com

Server: 100.100.111.1
Address: 100.100.111.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:

Name: github.com
Address: 100.96.0.1
```

Notice in the above process that at no point does the Client's system resolver
see the actual IP address of the Resource. This ensures that your DNS data
remains private and secure.

For a deeper dive into how (and why) DNS works this way in Firezone, see the
[How DNS works in Firezone](/blog/how-dns-works-in-firezone) article.

### Why Firezone uses a mapped address for DNS Resources

This is a common source of confusion among new Firezone users, so it's helpful
to explain why Firezone uses mapped IPs for DNS Resources instead of simply
using the actual resolved IP.

Consider the case where two DNS Resources resolve to the same IP address, such
as when Name-based virtual hosting is used to host two web applications on the
same server:

- `gitlab.company.com` resolves to IP `172.16.0.5`
- `jenkins.company.com` _also_ resolves to IP `172.16.0.5`

Remember that routing happens **at the IP level**. We can't independently route
packets for the same IP to two different places. If Firezone used the Resource's
actual IP address to route packets, the User would be able to access
`jenkins.company.com` if they were granted access only to `gitlab.company.com`.

Using mapped IPs allows Firezone to securely route DNS Resources **no matter how
many other services share the same IP address**.

## High availability

Firezone was designed from the ground up to support high availability
requirements. This is achieved through a combination of **load balancing** and
**automatic failover**, described below.

### Load balancing

When a Client wants to connect to a Resource, Firezone randomly selects a
healthy Gateway in the Site to handle the request. The Client maintains the
connection to that Gateway until either the Client disconnects or the Gateway
becomes unhealthy.

This effectively shards Client connections across all Gateways in a Site,
achieving higher overall throughput than otherwise possible with a single
Gateway.

### Automatic failover

Two or more Gateways deployed within a Site provide automatic failover in the
event of a Gateway failure.

Here's how it works:

1. When the admin portal detects a particular Gateway is unhealthy, it will stop
   using it for new connection requests to Resources in the Site.
1. Existing Clients will remain connected to the Gateway until they themselves
   detect it to be unhealthy.
1. Clients identify unhealthy gateways using keepalive timers. If the timer
   expires, the Client will disconnect from the unhealthy Gateway and request a
   new, healthy one from the portal.
1. The Client keepalive timer expires after **10 seconds**. This is the maximum
   time it takes for existing Client connections to be rerouted to a healthy
   Gateway in the event of a Gateway failure.

By using two independent health checks in the portal and the Client, Firezone
ensures that temporary network issues between the Client and portal do not
interrupt existing connections to healthy Gateways.
