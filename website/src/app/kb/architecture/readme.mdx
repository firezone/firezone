# Architecture Overview

This section of the documentation contains a deep dive into the Firezone product
architecture, intended for technical decision-makers and curious readers alike
who want a better understanding of how Firezone works under the hood.

<Alert color="info">
  **Remember**: Firezone is open source. If you really want to see how
  everything works, we encourage you to [read the
  code](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone).

## Introduction

At its core, Firezone is a secure remote access platform that connects users to
computing resources.

These resources can be anything from a private web application or database to
public SaaS apps and even entire subnets. Firezone makes no assumptions about
what you want to secure access to.

Firezone operates at layer 3 of the
[OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). This means it can secure
any resource that can be accessed over IP, include TCP, UDP, and HTTP-based
services, similar to traditional VPNs.

### What's different about Firezone?

Unlike traditional VPNs, however, Firezone has the following key differences:

- **Open source**: All source code is available for anyone to audit on
  [GitHub](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone).
- **Scalable**: Firezone was designed to be horizontally scalable from the
  start. Simply deploy more
  [Gateways](/kb/architecture/core-components#gateways) to handle more traffic.
- **Secure**: Firezone is built on [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com)®, a
  fast, provably-secure VPN protocol. Firezone further builds on this security
  with ephemeral encryption keys and firewall hole-punching to limit your
  exposed attack surface.
- **Easy to manage**: No firewall configuration or complex ACLs are required.
  Firezone's [Policy Engine](/kb/architecture/core-components#policy-engine)
  makes access easy to manage and audit at scale.

### Key design principles

Firezone was built to secure organizations in a world where traditional
perimeter-based security models are no longer effective.

The global workforce is increasingly remote, and the resources they need to
access are distributed across multiple cloud providers and on-premises data
centers. This creates a complex security challenge for organizations looking to
maintain a strong security posture.

To address these challenges, Firezone incorporates the following key design
principles:

- **Zero trust architecture**: Firezone follows what's commonly known as a
  [Zero Trust security model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model).
  This means all users and devices are untrusted by default and must be
  authenticated and authorized continuously before accessing each protected
  Resource. Firezone's architecture draws heavily from The National Institute of
  Standards and Technology (NIST)'s
  [published guidelines on zero trust architecture](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-207).
- **Integration with existing identity providers**: Identity verification is
  paramount to any Zero Trust architecture. Firezone
  [integrates](/kb/authenticate/oidc) with virtually any identity provider to
  authenticate your users in a secure and standards-compliant way.
  [Directory sync](/kb/directory-sync) takes this a step further to
  ensure Firezone always has the latest user and group information to use when
  evaluating access Policies.
- **Portable and reliable**: Firezone can only protect resources where it's
  deployed. If Firezone doesn't work reliably on a particular server or end-user
  device, it won't be used, and that creates a potential entrypoint for
  attackers. Firezone's tech stack
  [was chosen carefully](/kb/architecture/tech-stack) to make sure it runs
  reliably on a wide variety of platforms and devices.
