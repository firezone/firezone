# Quickstart Guide

Use this guide if you're new to Firezone or just want to get up and running
quickly with the some of the most common configuration options.

<Alert color="info">
  For a more detailed deployment guide, see our [Deploy Firezone](/kb/deploy)
  guide.
</Alert>

After following this guide, you'll end up with a Firezone deployment that looks
similar to the following diagram:

<Image
  src="/images/firezone-v1-architecture-simple.png"
  alt="Firezone simplified architecture"
  width={900}
  height={50}
  className="mx-auto shadow-sm rounded-sm"
/>

This quickstart guide illustrates a simple Firezone setup. Firezone supports
more complex deployments than the diagram illustrated above, but by starting
with the basics laid out here you'll get a better sense for how to deploy
Firezone for your specific use case.

You'll be able to change everything covered in this guide later, so don't worry
if you make a mistake or two.

## Prerequisites

- Firezone account. Don't have an account?
  [Sign up](https://app.firezone.dev/sign_up).
- Resource you want to give users secure access to (e.g. prod server, database
  SaaS application, or subnet)
- Server or VM you're able to deploy a Docker container or Linux binary on that
  can connect to both the Resource and the internet

## Summary

1. **Sign in to your Firezone Admin Portal** (e.g.
   `https://app.firezone.dev/example_company`)
1. **Create a Site** - Sites are where admins manage Resources, and Gateways
   that enable access to those Resources (e.g. US-West, Chicago-office).
1. **Deploy a Gateway** - Gateways are Site-specific, and provide connectivity
   between the Firezone Client and Resources in a Site.
1. **Add a Resource** - A Resource is anything you'd like to give users secure
   access to (e.g. a server/VM, database, subnet).
1. **Create a Policy for each Resource** - A Policy defines which user-groups
   can access a Resource (note: access is default-deny, which means a user can't
   access a Resource until a Policy permitting access is created).
1. **Download the Firezone Client**

Instructions below follow the same order as the summary above. If you follow the
instructions sequentially from top to bottom, you should end up with a working
Firezone network that looks like the architecture diagram at the top of this
guide.

### Signing In

In your browser, visit your unique sign-in URL, which can be found in the
**Welcome to Firezone** email you received after you created your account. Once
on the sign-in page, enter your email and click the sign-in button. You'll
receive another email with a sign in link and token. You may either click the
link to be signed in automatically on the device you're using, or copy the token
value and enter it in to the form on the sign-in page.

### Create a Site

When you log in to the admin portal, you'll be taken to the Sites page. The
first step will be to create a Site by clicking the 'Add Site' button. We'll
auto-generate a name for the Site, but you should consider renaming it something
relevant like `Production`, `US-West`, or `Chicago-office`.

After the Site is created, you'll be forwarded to the Site Details page where
you can continue the setup process.

### Deploy a Gateway

Gateways run on your infrastructure (server, VM, etc.) and must have access to
the internet as well as the Resource you'd like to share via Firezone.

Clicking **Deploy a Gateway** on the Site Details page will give you two options
for deploying a Gateway: `Docker` or `systemd` (choose whichever method you
prefer, and follow the instruction on that page).

When a Gateway has been successfully deployed, you will be redirected to the
Site Details page where the Gateway will now be listed and shown as online.

### Add a Resource

A Resource is simply anything the Gateway can reach that you'd like to give
users access to. Examples include servers, databases, applications, and even
entire subnets.

<Alert color="info">
  The more granular you can be with your Resources, the more control you'll have
  over who can access them.
</Alert>

On the Site Details page, click on the **Add Resource** button. You will now be
able to enter the `name` and `address` for a Resource. The `name` can be
anything you choose, and the `address` must be one of the following:

- IP address (e.g. `10.1.2.3` or `2001:db8::1`)
- Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) (e.g. `example.com`)
- CIDR Range (e.g. `10.10.10.0/24` or `2001:db8::/48`)

Optionally, you're given the option to provide an `Address description` which,
if provided, will be what's shown as the Resource address in the Clients when
users sign in.

After adding a Resource, you'll need to create a policy authorizing one or more
user-groups to access that Resource. End-users cannot access a Resource unless
they are members of a group that has explicit access to that Resource.

### Create a Policy

Navigate to the Policies page by clicking the **Policies** button in the
left-side menu bar. Select a Resource, and choose which groups can access that
Resource. Save the Policy.

### Install the Firezone Client

When you're finished in the Admin Portal, end-users can connect to available
Resources by
[installing the Firezone Client for their platform](/kb/client-apps), and
signing in.

After installing the Client, you can sign in by tapping **Sign in** (mobile
clients) or clicking **Sign in** from the menubar dropdown (desktop clients) and
entering your **Account slug** in the sign in form.

You now have secure access to Resources shown in the **Resources** section.
