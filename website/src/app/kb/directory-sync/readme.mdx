# How Directory Sync Works

</PlanBadge>

On Enterprise plans, Firezone supports directory sync from Google Workspace,
Microsoft Entra ID, and Okta. To enable directory sync, follow the guide for
your identity provider:

- [Sync with Google Workspace](/kb/directory-sync/google)
- [Sync with Microsoft Entra ID](/kb/directory-sync/entra)
- [Sync with Okta](/kb/directory-sync/okta)

Once activated, users, groups, and organizational units will sync automatically
every 2 hours. You can trigger a manual sync at any time by clicking **Sync
Now** on the directory card in `Settings -> Directory Sync`.

## Role mapping

All synced users are assigned the unprivileged `User` role by default. This role
is allowed to sign in from the Firezone Client, but has no access to the admin
portal. If you need to grant a synced user access to the admin portal, you can
manually assign the user the `Admin` role by going to
`Actors → <actor name> → Edit User` and updating their role appropriately.

Automatic role mapping is not currently supported. If this is a feature you
would like to see, please let us know by
[leaving a comment](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/5931) on our
GitHub issue tracker.

## How Firezone treats deleted entities

When you delete a user or group in your identity provider, Firezone deletes them
upon the next sync.

### Deleting or suspending a user

When a user is deleted or suspended in your identity provider, Firezone will
delete the associated identity the user signs in with, clearing all active
Client and admin portal web sessions for that identity. The user will be
immediately **signed out of all Client and admin portal sessions**.

This ensures terminated employees will have all Firezone access revoked upon the
next sync after deleting or suspending them in your identity provider.

### Deleting a group or organizational unit

When a group or organizational unit is deleted in your identity provider,
Firezone will delete the group and all associated Policies. Any access granted
by those Policies **will be immediately revoked**.

## Nested groups and organizational units

Firezone syncs nested (sometimes called "transitive") memberships from your
identity provider. This means user membership for a particular group is
determined not only by its immediate members, but any child groups as well. This
allows you to create nested group structures in your identity provider and have
their memberships automatically reflected in Firezone.

For example, if you had the following group structure in your identity provider:

```yaml
Everyone:
  - steve@company.com
  Support:
    - patrick@company.com
  Engineering:
    - bob@company.com
    - alice@company.com
    Devops:
      - john@company.com
```

You would see the following group memberships in Firezone after sync:

```yaml
Group:Everyone:
  - steve@company.com
  - patrick@company.com
  - bob@company.com
  - alice@company.com
  - john@company.com
Group:Engineering:
  - bob@company.com
  - alice@company.com
  - john@company.com
Group:Support:
  - patrick@company.com
Group:DevOps:
  - john@company.com
```
