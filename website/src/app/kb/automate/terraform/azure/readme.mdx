# Deploy Firezone on Azure with Terraform

In this guide, we'll deploy a cluster of Firezone Gateways in a private subnet
on Azure that are configured to egress traffic to the internet through an
[Azure NAT Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-nat-gateway).

## Common use cases

Use this guide to give your Firezone Clients a static, public IP address for
egress traffic to particular Resource(s). Here are some common use cases for
this example:

- Access your protected Azure workloads using with scalable, high-performance
  WireGuard tunnels.
- Use an IP allowlist to access a third-party or partner application such as a
  client's DB or third-party API.
- Use an IP allowlist with your identity provider to lock down access to a
  public application.
- Enabling a team of remote contractors access to a regionally-locked
  application or service.

## High availability

All Firezone Gateways deployed in this example will automatically failover and
load balance for each other.

## Prerequisites

1. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
1. [Azure account](https://portal.azure.com) with the necessary permissions to
   create the resources.
1. Set up your Terraform environment to work with Azure. See
   [this tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/azure-build)
   if you haven't yet done so.
1. A [Firezone Site](https://www.firezone.dev/kb/deploy/sites) dedicated to use
   for this example. This Site should contain **only** the Firezone Gateway(s)
   deployed in this example and any associated Resources.
1. A Firezone Gateway token. This can be obtained by viewing your Site in the
   admin portal, clicking the `Deploy Gateway` button, and navigating to the
   instructions for the `Terraform` tab. Gateway tokens support multi-use, so
   only a single token is needed to provision the Firezone Gateways in this
   guide.

## Sizing

Simply update the number of `desired_capacity` to deploy more or fewer Firezone
Gateways. There's no limit to the number of Firezone Gateways you can deploy in
a single Vnet. A basic Azure Autoscale configuration is provisioned as part of
the linked module.

<Alert color="warning">
  If you need more than 64,512 concurrent connections, you can increase the
  number of public IP addresses reserved for the Azure NAT Gateway. See [Azure's
  documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/troubleshoot-nat-connectivity)
  for more information.
</Alert>

We've tested with `Standard_B1ls` instances which still work quite well for most
applications. However, you may want to consider a larger instance type if you
have a high volume of traffic or lots of concurrent connections. See
[Gateway sizing recommendations](/kb/deploy/gateways#sizing-recommendations) for
some general guidelines depending on your expected traffic.

## Deployment

1. [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firezone/terraform-azurerm-gateway/main/examples/nat-gateway/main.tf)
   the `main.tf` from the example module.
1. Customize it as desired. At a minimum, you will need to set the
   `firezone_token` and change `admin_ssh_key` to match your environment.
1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory and download the
   required providers.
1. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the Firezone Gateway(s) into your AWS
   project.

You can see the IP address assigned to the NAT Gateway in the Terraform output.
These are the IP address that your Firezone Gateway(s) will share to egress
traffic.

<Alert color="info">
  It can sometimes take **up to 30 minutes** for all of the resources in this
  example to provision and connect to the portal. If you suspect the Gateway(s)
  are not connecting, follow the instructions in the [troubleshooting
  guide](/kb/administer/troubleshooting) to diagnose the issue.
</Alert>

<Alert color="warning">
  Azure disables ICMP for VMs without a public IP attached, so you won't be able
  to ping internet hosts from the Firezone Gateway(s) or vice versa. This is
  normal and expected. TCP and UDP traffic will work as expected using the
  example configuration in this guide.
</Alert>

After a few minutes, you should see the Firezone Gateway(s) appear in the
Firezone admin portal. You can now configure your Resources to use the new
Firezone Gateway(s) you just provisioned.

## Upgrading

To upgrade the Firezone Gateway(s) to the latest version, we recommend setting a
version to deploy with the `firezone_version` variable. Then, whenever you want
to upgrade, update this variable and run `terraform apply`, which will trigger a
new deployment of the Firezone Gateway(s) with the new version.

<Alert color="info">
  You can follow the latest releases of the Gateway at our [changelog
  page](https://www.firezone.dev/changelog).
</Alert>

This will incur a few minutes of downtime as Terraform destroys the existing
Firezone Gateway(s) and deploys new ones in their place.

## Output

`nat_public_ip` will contain the public IP address of the NAT Gateway you can
use to whitelist your Firezone Gateway(s) in your third-party or partner
application.

# Cleanup

To clean up the resources created by this example, run `terraform destroy`.
