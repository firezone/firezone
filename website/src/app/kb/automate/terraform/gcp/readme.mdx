# Deploy Firezone on GCP with Terraform

In this example, we will deploy one or more Firezone Gateways in a single VPC on
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that are configured to egress traffic through a
single Cloud NAT that is assigned a single static IP address.

This example is built on top of our example module for deploying a
[Firezone Gateway in Google Cloud](https://github.com/firezone/terraform-google-gateway/tree/main/examples/nat-gateway).

## Common use cases

Use this guide to give your Firezone Clients a static public IP address for
egress traffic to particular Resource(s). Here are some common use cases for
this example:

- Use IP whitelisting to access a third-party or partner application such as a
  client's DB or third-party API.
- Use IP whitelisting with your identity provider to lock down access to a
  public application.
- Enabling a team of remote contractors access to a regionally-locked
  application or service.

## High availability

All Firezone Gateways deployed in this example will automatically failover and
load balance for each other. No other configuration is necessary.

## Prerequisites

1. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
1. [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account](https://cloud.google.com/)
1. [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
1. [Enable the Compute Engine API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=compute.googleapis.com)
1. A [Firezone Site](/kb/deploy/sites) dedicated to use for this example. This
   Site should contain **only** the Firezone Gateway(s) deployed in this example
   and any associated Resources.
1. A Firezone Gateway token. This can be obtained by viewing your Site in the
   admin portal, clicking the `Deploy Gateway` button, and navigating to the
   instructions for the `Terraform` tab. Gateway tokens support multi-use, so
   only a single token is needed to provision the Firezone Gateways in this
   guide.

## Sizing

Simply update the number of replicas to deploy more or fewer Firezone Gateways.
There's no limit to the number of Firezone Gateways you can deploy in a single
VPC.

<Alert color="warning">

If you need more than 64,512 concurrent connections, you can increase the number
of public IP addresses reserved for the Cloud NAT. See
[Google's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/ports-and-addresses#ports)
for more information.

</Alert>

We've tested with `e2-micro` instances which still work quite well for most
applications. However, you may want to consider a larger instance type if you
have a high volume of traffic or lots of concurrent connections. See
[Gateway sizing recommendations](/kb/deploy/gateways#sizing-recommendations) for
some general guidelines depending on your expected traffic.

## Deployment

1. Clone the module to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/firezone/terraform-google-gateway
```

1. cd into the `examples/nat-gateway` directory.

```
cd terraform-google-gateway/examples/nat-gateway
```

1. Configure the necessary Terraform
   [variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables).
   Here's an example `terraform.tfvars` you can use as a starting point:

   ```hcl
   project_id     = "my-gcp-project"
   region         = "us-west1"
   zone           = "us-west1-a"
   token          = "<YOUR GATEWAY TOKEN>"
   replicas       = 3
   machine_type   = "f1-micro"
   log_level      = "info"
   ```

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory and download the
   required providers.
1. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the Firezone Gateway(s) into your GCP
   project.

You can see the static IP address assigned to the Cloud NAT in the Terraform
output. This is the IP address that your Firezone Gateway(s) will use to egress
traffic.

You can verify all Firezone Gateways are using this IP by viewing the Site in
the Firezone admin portal, where you should now see the Firezone Gateway(s)
listed as `Online`.

/>

<Alert color="info">

It can sometimes take **up to 30 minutes** for all of the resources in this
example to provision and connect to the portal. If you suspect the Gateway(s)
are not connecting, follow the instructions in the
[troubleshooting guide](/kb/administer/troubleshooting) to diagnose the issue.

</Alert>

## Upgrading

To upgrade the Firezone Gateway(s) to the latest version, we recommend setting a
version to deploy with the `vsn` variable. Then, whenever you want to upgrade,
update this variable and run `terraform apply`, which will trigger a new
deployment of the Firezone Gateway(s) with the new version.

<Alert color="info">

You can follow the latest releases of the Gateway at our
[changelog page](https://www.firezone.dev/changelog).

</Alert>

This will incur a few minutes of downtime as Terraform destroys the existing
Firezone Gateway(s) and deploys new ones in their place.

## Output

`static_ip_addresses` will contain a list of static IP addresses that you can
use to whitelist your Firezone Gateway(s) in your third-party or partner
application.

# Cleanup

To clean up the resources created by this example, run `terraform destroy`.
