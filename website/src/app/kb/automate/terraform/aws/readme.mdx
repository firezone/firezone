# Deploy Firezone on AWS with Terraform

In this guide, we'll deploy a cluster of Firezone Gateways in a private subnet
on AWS that are configured to egress traffic to the internet through an AWS
[NAT Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html).

## Common use cases

Use this guide to give your Firezone Clients a static, public IP address for
egress traffic to particular Resource(s). Here are some common use cases for
this example:

- Use an IP allowlist to access a third-party or partner application such as a
  client's DB or third-party API.
- Use an IP allowlist with your identity provider to lock down access to a
  public application.
- Enabling a team of remote contractors access to a regionally-locked
  application or service.

## High availability

All Firezone Gateways deployed in this example will automatically failover and
load balance for each other.

## Prerequisites

1. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
1. [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) with the necessary permissions to
   create the resources.
1. A [Firezone Site](https://www.firezone.dev/kb/deploy/sites) dedicated to use
   for this example. This Site should contain **only** the Firezone Gateway(s)
   deployed in this example and any associated Resources.
1. A Firezone Gateway token. See
   [Multiple Gateways](/kb/deploy/gateways#deploy-multiple-gateways) for
   instructions on how to obtain a Firezone Gateway token that can be used
   across multiple instances.

## Sizing

Simply update the number of `desired_capacity` to deploy more or fewer Firezone
Gateways. There's no limit to the number of Firezone Gateways you can deploy in
a single VPC. A basic AutoScaling Group is provisioned as part of the linked
module.

We've tested with `t3.nano` instances which still work quite well for most
applications. However, you may want to consider a larger instance type if you
have a high volume of traffic or lots of concurrent connections.

## Deployment

1. [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firezone/firezone/main/terraform/examples/aws/nat-gateway/main.tf)
   the `main.tf` from the example module.
1. Customize it as desired. At a minimum, you will need to set the
   `firezone_token` and change `base_ami` and `region` to match your
   environment.
1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory and download the
   required providers.
1. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the Firezone Gateway(s) into your AWS
   project.

You can see the IP addresses assigned to the NAT Gateway in the Terraform
output. These are the IP addresses that your Firezone Gateway(s) will share to
egress traffic.

## Upgrading

To upgrade the Firezone Gateway(s) to the latest version, simply update the
`token` and issue a `terraform apply` which will trigger a redeployment of the
Firezone Gateway(s).

This will incur a few minutes of downtime as Terraform destroys the existing
Firezone Gateway(s) and deploys new ones in their place.

## Output

`nat_public_ip` will contain the public IP address of the NAT Gateway you can
use to whitelist your Firezone Gateway(s) in your third-party or partner
application.

# Cleanup

To clean up the resources created by this example, run `terraform destroy`.
