# Route Traffic Through a Public IP

</PlanBadge>

In this guide, we'll walk through the configuration required to use Firezone to
route traffic through a public IP address, sometimes known as a NAT Gateway
configuration.

Use this when you need your team's traffic to appear to come from a single,
static IP address to use services that require source traffic to come from
specified IP allowlists.

After completing this guide, your team's traffic will be routed to a Firezone
Gateway and then out to the internet using its public IP address.

<Alert color="info">
  See our our [Terraform examples](/kb/automate/terraform) for a high
  availability example of this guide using Terraform on Google Cloud Platform.
</Alert>

## Prerequisites

- A Site reserved for this use case. [Create a Site](/kb/deploy/sites) if you
  haven't already.
- One or more Gateways deployed within the Site.
  [Deploy a Gateway](/kb/deploy/gateways) if you haven't done so yet.

<Alert color="warning">
  This guide assumes the Gateway has a public IP attached. This is required to
  function as a NAT gateway.
</Alert>

## Step 1: Create Resource(s) matching the traffic you want to route

1. In your [admin portal](https://app.firezone.dev), go to `Sites -> <site>` and
   click the `Add Resource` button.
1. Add Resource(s) for each service that requires an IP allowlist. For example,
   if you need traffic to `*.gitlab.company.com` to appear to come from your
   Gateway's public IP address, you would enter `*.gitlab.company.com` as the
   Resource address.
1. Optionally, add a Resource with address `ifconfig.net` to the Site as well.
   This will be used later to verify that your traffic is being routed through
   the Gateway's public IP.

## Step 2: Create Policies

1. In the `Policies` tab, click the `Add Policy` button.
2. Create a Policy for each of the Resources you created in Step (1). Be sure to
   select the appropriate Group and Resource for each Policy.

## Step 3: Done!

That's it!

If you added the `ifconfig.net` Resource above, you can verify that your traffic
is being routed through the Gateway by visiting `https://ifconfig.net` in your
browser and ensuring the IP displayed matches the public IP address of your
Gateway.
