# Scale Access to a VPC

</PlanBadge>

In this guide, we'll use Firezone to scale your team's access to a VPC.

This is commonly used when you need fast, reliable access to your cloud
computing resources which are located behind a cloud firewall.

After completing this guide, your team's traffic into the VPC will be load
balanced across multiple Gateways for high availability.

<Alert color="warning">
  Opening ports on your network firewall is **not** necessary or recommended.
  Firezone Gateways perform secure NAT traversal for you.
</Alert>

## Prerequisites

- A Site reserved for this use case. [Create a Site](/kb/deploy/sites) if you
  haven't already.
- Two or more Gateways deployed within the Site.
  [Deploy a Gateway](/kb/deploy/gateways) if you haven't done so yet.

<Alert color="info">
  See our [Terraform examples](/kb/automate/terraform) to learn how to automate
  deployments to various cloud providers.

## Step 1: Create a Resource

1. In your [admin portal](https://app.firezone.dev), go to `Sites -> <site>` and
   click the `Add Resource` button.
1. Select `CIDR` as the Resource type.
1. Enter the CIDR range of the VPC you want to secure access to. This should be
   a range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses that's directly reachable from the
   Gateway(s) in your Site.
1. Name the Resource something descriptive, like `SJC demo net`. You'll refer to
   this name when creating a Policy in the next step.
1. Click `Save`.

## Step 2: Create a Policy

1. In the `Policies` tab, click the `Add Policy` button.
1. Select an appropriate Group and the the Resource you created in Step (1).
1. Click `Save`.

## Step 3: Done!

You should now be able to access hosts and services in the VPC you specified in
Step (1).
