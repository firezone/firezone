# Viewing logs

Firezone maintains diagnostic log files in various locations depending on the
component and operating system. Logs are scrubbed for sensitive and
personally-identifiable information before being written to disk.

Diagnostic logs are used primarily by the Firezone team for troubleshooting
connectivity and other issues, but they may also be useful for diagnosing issues
by advanced users and admins.

## Log directory locations

## Exporting Client logs

Log files can be conveniently exported from the macOS, iOS, Android/ChromeOS,
and Windows/Linux GUI Clients from the "Diagnostic Logs" tab of the Settings
screen. This will bundle the logs from the log directory listed above into an
archive file that can be easily shared.

## Exporting Gateway logs

<TabsGroup>
<TabsItem title="Docker" active>

To export logs from the Gateway Docker container, use the `docker logs` command
and redirect the output to a file:

```bash
docker logs firezone-gateway > firezone-gateway.log
```

See the
[Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/logs/)
for a full list of log drivers and options available.

</TabsItem>
<TabsItem title="systemd">

To export logs from the Gateway systemd service, use the `journalctl` command
and redirect the output to a file:

```bash
journalctl -u firezone-gateway > firezone-gateway.log
```

See the
[journalctl manpage](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/journalctl.1.html)
for a full list of options available.

## Clearing logs

For the Gateway and Headless Clients, simply delete the files in the log
directories listed above.

For macOS, iOS, Android/ChromeOS, and Windows/Linux GUI Clients, log directories
can be cleared in the "Diagnostic Logs" tab in the Settings screen.
