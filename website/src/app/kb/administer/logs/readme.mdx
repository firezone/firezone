# Diagnostic logs

Firezone maintains diagnostic log files in various locations depending on the
component and operating system. Logs are scrubbed for sensitive and
personally-identifiable information before being written to disk.

Diagnostic logs are used primarily by the Firezone team for troubleshooting
connectivity and other issues.

Below is a table listing the various log directories used by each component.

| Component               | Log directory                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS client            | `~/Library/Group Containers/47R2M6779T.group.dev.firezone.firezone/Library/Caches/logs` |
| iOS client              | N/A                                                                                     |
| Android/ChromeOS client | `/data/data/dev.firezone.android/caches/logs`                                           |
| Linux client            | Set by the user via the `LOG_DIR` environment variable                                  |
| Gateway                 | Logs are written to STDOUT by default                                                   |
