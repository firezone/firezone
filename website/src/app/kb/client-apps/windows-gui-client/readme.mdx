# Windows GUI Client

The Windows GUI Client is designed for Windows computers where a user is present
to authenticate with your identity provider interactively.

<Alert color="info">
  If you're looking for a headless client suitable for server or workstation use
  cases where a user is not physically present, see the [Windows Headless
  Client](/kb/client-apps/windows-headless-client) user guide instead, which
  uses a long-lived Service Account token for authentication.
</Alert>

## Prerequisites

- **Windows 10** or higher, or **Windows Server 2016** or higher
- **x86-64** CPU
- [**WebView2**](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
  (The installer will install this automatically if needed)

## Installation

Download the `.msi` installer from [our changelog page](/changelog) or from the
direct link below:

- [Download the Windows `.msi` installer for `x86-64`](/dl/firezone-client-gui-windows/latest/x86_64)

After downloading, run the `.msi` to install the Firezone GUI Client.

To auto-start the Client when you log in, copy the "Firezone" shortcut from your
desktop to `%APPDATA%/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/`

## Usage

### Signing in

1. Run Firezone
1. At the Welcome screen, click `Sign in`. This will open the Firezone sign-in
   page in your default web browser.
1. Sign in using your account slug and identity provider.
1. If your browser asks whether it should open Firezone links, check
   `Always allow` and open the link.
1. When you see the `Firezone connected` notification, Firezone is running.

The Welcome screen only appears during your first sign-in. After that, you can
click on the Firezone icon in the system tray to open the tray menu and sign in.

### Accessing a Resource

When Firezone is signed in, web browsers and other programs will automatically
use it to securely connect to Resources.

To copy-paste the address of a Resource:

1. Right-click on the Firezone tray icon to open the menu.
1. Open a Resource's submenu and click on its address to copy it.
1. Paste the address into your browser's URL bar and press Enter.

### Quitting

1. Right-click on the Firezone tray icon to open the menu.
1. Click `Disconnect and Quit` or `Quit`.

When Firezone is not running, you can't access private Resources, and the
computer will use its normal DNS and Internet behavior.

If you were signed in, then you will still be signed in the next time you start
Firezone.

### Signing out

1. Right-click on the Firezone tray icon to open the menu.
1. Click `Sign out`.

When you're signed out, you can't access private Resources, and the computer
will use its normal DNS and Internet behavior.

## Upgrading

The Windows Client will automatically check for updates on launch and prompt you
to upgrade when a new version is available.

To upgrade:

1. Download the latest `.msi` installer package from
   ["Installation"](#installation) above.
1. Quit the Client
1. Install the new `.msi`

## Diagnostic logs

Firezone writes log files to disk. These logs stay on your computer and are not
transmitted anywhere. If you find a bug, you can send us a `.zip` archive of
your logs to help us fix the bug.

To export or clear your logs:

1. Right-click on the Firezone tray icon.
1. Click `Settings`.
1. Click `Diagnostic Logs`.
1. Click `Export Logs` or `Clear Log Directory`.

## Uninstalling

1. Delete the "Firezone" shortcut from
   `%APPDATA%/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/`
1. Quit Firezone.
1. Open the Start Menu. Search for `Add or remove programs` and open it.
1. In the `Add or remove programs` dialog, search for `Firezone`.
1. Click on Firezone and click `Uninstall`.

## Troubleshooting

### Firezone is signed in, but I can't access Resources

If the Firezone client shows that you are signed in, but you can't access
Resources, it's possible that the WinTUN driver is corrupted or in a failed
state.

To fix, perform these steps:

1. Uninstall Firezone and any other WireGuard-based VPN software from your
   computer.
2. Reset your network settings by going to
   `Settings -> Network and Internet -> Additional network settings -> Network Reset -> Reset now`.
3. Reinstall Firezone and any other software you previously uninstalled.

### Check if Firezone Client IPC service is running

In the Start Menu, search for "Windows Powershell". Open it and run this
command:

```pwsh
Get-Service -Name FirezoneClientIpcService
```

Good output

```text
Status   Name               DisplayName
------   ----               -----------
Running  FirezoneClientI... Firezone Client IPC
```

Bad output

```text
Status   Name               DisplayName
------   ----               -----------
Stopped  FirezoneClientI... Firezone Client IPC
```

### Check if Firezone is controlling DNS

In the Start Menu, search for "Windows Powershell". Open it and run this
command:

```pwsh
Get-DnsClientNrptPolicy
```

Firezone Split DNS example:

```text
Namespace                        : .
QueryPolicy                      :
SecureNameQueryFallback          :
DirectAccessIPsecCARestriction   :
DirectAccessProxyName            :
DirectAccessDnsServers           :
DirectAccessEnabled              :
DirectAccessProxyType            : NoProxy
DirectAccessQueryIPsecEncryption :
DirectAccessQueryIPsecRequired   : False
NameServers                      : {100.100.111.1, fd00:2021:1111:8000:100:100:111:0}
DnsSecIPsecCARestriction         :
DnsSecQueryIPsecEncryption       :
DnsSecQueryIPsecRequired         : False
DnsSecValidationRequired         : False
NameEncoding                     : Utf8WithoutMapping
```

If Firezone's Split DNS is not active, the output will be empty.

### Revert Firezone DNS control

If Firezone crashes and does not revert control of the system's DNS, you can
revert it manually with this command:

```pwsh
Get-DnsClientNrptRule | where Comment -eq firezone-fd0020211111 | foreach { Remove-DnsClientNrptRule -Name $_.Name -Force }
```

1. Right-click on the Start Menu
1. Click "Terminal (Admin)" to open a Powershell terminal with admin privileges
1. When UAC asks "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?"
   click `Yes`
1. Enter the above command and
   [Check if Firezone is controlling DNS](#check-if-firezone-is-controlling-dns)

### Viewing logs

The Firezone Client is split into 2 main processes: An IPC service which runs
the tunnel, and a GUI which allows the user to control Firezone.

- IPC service logs are stored at `%PROGRAMDATA%\dev.firezone.client\data\logs\`,
  where `%PROGRAMDATA%` is almost always `C:\ProgramData`
- GUI logs are stored at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dev.firezone.client\data\logs`, where
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%` is, e.g. `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local`

## Known issues

  ignored. [#8430](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/8430).
