# Android Client

Firezone supports Android and ChromeOS with a native client available in the
Google Play Store.

## Prerequisites

- **Android**: x86, x86-64, ARM, and ARM64 devices running Android 8 or higher
  are supported.
- **ChromeOS**: x86, x86-64, ARM, and ARM64 Chromebooks running the Android 11
  subsystem or higher are supported.

## Installation

1. [Download the Firezone app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.firezone.android)
   from the Google Play Store or
   [download an APK](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone/releases) from
   GitHub.
1. Run the app. The welcome screen will show "Enable VPN Permission" and the
   Firezone logo.
1. Tap `Request Permission`. Android will show a dialog saying,
   `Connection request`.
1. Tap `OK`. Firezone will switch to the `Signed Out` screen.

## Usage

### Signing in

1. Tap `Sign In`. Firezone will open a sign-in page in your web browser.
1. Select your account and sign in. Firezone will show your username and
   Resources.

### Accessing a Resource

When Firezone is signed in, web browsers and other programs will automatically
use it to securely connect to Resources.

To copy-paste the address of a Resource:

1. Tap on the Resource.
1. Tap on the address, e.g. `example.com`. Firezone will copy the address to the
   clipboard.
1. Open your web browser, such as Google Chrome.
1. Paste the link you copied from Firezone.
1. Tap the enter or arrow icon on your keyboard to navigate to the link.

### Signing out

1. Open the Firezone app
1. Tap `Sign Out` in the bottom-right corner.

When you're signed out, you can't access private Resources, and the device will
use its normal DNS and Internet behavior.

## Upgrading

Updates for the Android client are handled through the Google Play Store if you
installed the app from there. Consult the
[Play Store documentation](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/113412?hl=en)
for more information on how to update apps on your device.

If you installed the app from an APK directly, you will need to download and
install the new APK manually.

## Diagnostic logs

Firezone writes log files to the device's memory. These logs stay on the device
and are not transmitted anywhere. If you find a bug, you can send us a `.zip`
archive of your logs to help us fix the bug.

To export or clear your logs:

1. Open the Firezone app.
1. Tap `Settings` in the bottom-left corner.
1. Tap `Logs` in the bottom-right corner.
1. Tap `EXPORT LOGS` or `CLEAR LOG DIRECTORY`.

## Uninstalling

1. Go to the device's home screen.
1. Swipe up to open the app drawer.
1. Long-press the Firezone app icon. A menu will appear.
1. Tap `App info` in the menu. This will show the app info screen for Firezone.
1. Tap `Uninstall`. Android will show a dialog asking,
   `Do you want to uninstall this app?`.
1. Tap `OK`.

## Troubleshooting

We will add troubleshooting steps here in the future.
