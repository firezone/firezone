# Linux Headless Client

Headless Clients are designed to authenticate with long-lived
[service account](/kb/authenticate/service-accounts) tokens to enable
system-to-system connectivity where a user isn't present to authenticate with
your identity provider interactively.

<Alert color="info">
  If you're looking for a desktop Client that authenticates with your identity
  provider instead, see the [Linux GUI
  Client](/kb/client-apps/linux-gui-client).
</Alert>

## Prerequisites

- Any Linux-based OS with kernel 3.10 or higher
- ARM64, ARMv7l, or x86_64 CPU
- Administrator access to your Firezone account in order to create a service
  account and generate a token
- Root access or `sudo` for Split DNS

## Installation

Download the Linux headless Client from our [changelog page](/changelog), or use
one of the direct links below:

- [Download the Linux Client for `x86_64`](/dl/firezone-client-headless-linux/latest/x86_64)
- [Download the Linux Client for `ARMv7l`](/dl/firezone-client-headless-linux/latest/armv7)
- [Download the Linux Client for `ARM64`](/dl/firezone-client-headless-linux/latest/aarch64)

Mark the binary as executable:

```bash
chmod +x firezone-client-headless-linux_1.0.0_x86_64
```

## Usage

### Signing in

Headless Clients require a service account token to authenticate to Firezone.
You can generate a token using the instructions in the
[service account](/kb/authenticate/service-accounts) documentation.

Once you have a token, you can start the Client using the following command:

```bash
sudo FIREZONE_TOKEN=<TOKEN> ./firezone-client-headless-linux_1.0.0_x86_64
```

<Alert color="info">`sudo` is required to control the system's DNS.</Alert>

Set some environment variables to configure it:

```bash
export FIREZONE_NAME="Development API test client"
export FIREZONE_ID=$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | sha256sum | cut -d' ' -f1)
export FIREZONE_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
export LOG_DIR="./"
sudo -E ./firezone-client-headless-linux_1.0.0_x86_64
```

See [below](#environment-variable-reference) for a full list of environment
variables.

### Accessing a Resource

When Firezone is signed in, HTTP clients, SQL clients, and other programs will
automatically use it to securely connect to Resources.

### Split DNS

By default, Split DNS is **enabled** for the Linux headless Client as of version
1.1.5.

To disable Split DNS for the Linux Client, set the `FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL`
environment variable to `disabled`.

To control `/etc/resolv.conf` directly, set `FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL` to
`etc-resolv-conf`.

Read more below to figure out which DNS control method is appropriate for your
system.

#### systemd-resolved

On most modern Linux distributions, DNS resolution is handled by
`systemd-resolved`. If this is the case for you, do not set
`FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL`. If you're not sure whether you use `systemd-resolved`,
you can check by running the following command:

```bash
systemctl status systemd-resolved
```

Ensure that `/etc/resolv.conf` is a symlink to
`/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf`:

```bash
# Check if /etc/resolv.conf is already a symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
stat /etc/resolv.conf

# If it's not, create the symlink
sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf.new
sudo mv /etc/resolve.conf.new /etc/resolv.conf
```

#### NetworkManager

In most cases, if you're using NetworkManager your system already uses
`systemd-resolved`, and you should leave `FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL` unset, which
will use the default `systemd-resolved` DNS control method.

When NetworkManager detects that symlink exists, it will automatically use
`systemd-resolved` for DNS resolution and no other configuration is necessary.

#### /etc/resolv.conf

If you're not using `systemd-resolved`, Firezone supports using the
`/etc/resolv.conf` file to configure Split DNS as a fallback. To do this, set
`FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL` to `etc-resolv-conf`, and the Linux Client will override
the `/etc/resolv.conf` file with the Firezone internal proxy.

When the Linux Client process exits, it will revert the `/etc/resolv.conf` file
back to its original state. If for some reason this isn't the case, you can
easily restore it by running the following command:

```bash
sudo mv /etc/resolv.conf.before-firezone /etc/resolv.conf
```

1. Replace the existing binary with the new one.
1. Start the Client with the same environment variables as before.

## Diagnostic logs

Firezone writes log files to disk. These logs stay on your computer and are not
transmitted anywhere. If you encounter a bug, sending us the files may help us
fix the bug.

## Uninstalling

1. Stop the running Client
1. Delete the binary

## Troubleshooting

### Check if Firezone is controlling DNS with systemd-resolved DNS

```bash
resolvectl dns
```

Firezone Split DNS:

```text
Global:
Link 2 (enp0s6): 10.0.2.3 fec0::3
Link 3 (tun-firezone): 100.100.111.1 fd00:2021:1111:8000:100:100:111:0
```

Normal system DNS:

```text
Global:
Link 2 (enp0s6): 10.0.2.3 fec0::3
```

### Check if Firezone is controlling DNS with `/etc/resolv.conf`

Firezone Split DNS:

```text
# BEGIN Firezone DNS configuration
# If you modify this file, delete the above magic header line so that Firezone will
# obey your new default DNS config.
# If you see this text and Firezone is not running, then the last run of Firezone crashed.
# The original `resolv.conf` is backed up at /etc/resolv.conf.before-firezone
nameserver 100.100.111.1
search .
options edns0
options trust-ad
```

Normal system DNS:

```text
nameserver 192.168.1.1
```

### Check if Firezone is being used

Check if `curl` reports a remote IP in Firezone's range when you connect to a
Resource:

```text
> curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out %{remote_ip}\\n https://example.com
19.0.0.2
```

Firezone resources use the ranges `19.0.0.0/8` and
`fd00:2021:1111:8000::/107`.

### Revert `/etc/resolv.conf` DNS control

The `systemd-resolved` method reverts by itself when Firezone closes. However,
the `etc-resolv-conf` method can fail to revert if Firezone crashes.

Starting and stopping Firezone gracefully will cause it to try reverting
`/etc/resolv.conf`.

You can manually revert with:

```bash
sudo mv /etc/resolv.conf.before-firezone /etc/resolv.conf
```

## Known issues

- If a search domain is applied, the system search domains set manually or by
  DHCP are ignored. [#8430](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/8430).
