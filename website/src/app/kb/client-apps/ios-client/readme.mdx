# iOS Client

Firezone supports iOS with a native clients available in the iOS App Store. The
iOS app also works for iPad.

## Prerequisites

- **iOS 15** or higher

## Installation

   from the Apple App Store.

1. Tap `Grant VPN Permission`. iOS will show a dialog saying,
   `"Firezone" Would Like to Add VPN Configurations`.
1. Tap `Allow` and allow the permission using your passcode, FaceID, or TouchID.
   Firezone will then ask for notification permission.

## Usage

### Signing in

   `"Firezone" Wants to Use "firezone.dev" to Sign In`.
1. Tap `Continue`. Firezone will open a sign-in page.
1. Select your account and sign in. Firezone will show your username and
   Resources.

### Accessing a Resource

When Firezone is signed in, web browsers and other programs will automatically
use it to securely connect to Resources.

To copy-paste the address of a Resource:

1. Tap on the Resource.
1. Long-press `ADDRESS`.
1. Tap `Copy Address`. Firezone will copy the address to the clipboard.
1. Open your web browser.
1. Long-press your browser's URL bar and tap `Paste and Go`

### Quitting

1. Open the device's `Settings` app.
1. Tap `VPN` to turn the VPN switch off.

When Firezone is not running, you can't access private Resources, and the device
will use its normal DNS and Internet behavior.

If you were signed in, then you will still be signed in the next time you start
Firezone.

1. Open the Firezone app.
1. Tap the icon of a person in the top-left corner.
1. Tap `Sign out`.

When you're signed out, you can't access private Resources, and the device will

## Upgrading

Updates for the Apple clients are handled through the Apple App Store. Consult
[Apple's documentation](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/update-apps-iph98709f167/17.0/ios/17.0)
for more information on how to update apps on your device.

## Diagnostic logs

Firezone writes log files to the device's memory. These logs stay on the device
and are not transmitted anywhere. If you find a bug, you can send us an `.aar`
archive of your logs to help us fix the bug.

To export or clear your logs:

1. Open the Firezone app.
1. Tap the gear icon in the upper-right corner.
1. Tap `Diagnostic Logs` in the bottom-right corner.
1. Tap `Export Logs` or `Clear Log Directory`.

1. Tap `Remove App`.
1. Tap `Delete App`. iOS will show a dialog asking,
   `Delete "Firezone"? Deleting this app will also delete its data`.
1. Tap `Delete`.

## Troubleshooting

We will add troubleshooting steps here in the future.
