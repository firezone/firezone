# Create Users

</PlanBadge>

Users can be created by going to `Actors -> Add Actor` and then selecting `User`
as the actor type.

<Alert color="info">
  Automatic user sync is available for Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra ID, and
  Okta providers with the Enterprise plan. [Read
  more](/kb/directory-sync) about how it works or [contact
  sales](/contact/sales) to upgrade.
</Alert>

Users with the `User` role can only sign in to the Firezone Clients to access
Resources, while users with the `Admin` role can sign in to the admin portal to
perform administrative tasks as well as sign in to Firezone Clients to access
Resources.

After creating a user, you can assign the user to one or more groups. Groups
determine the policies that apply to the user, so it's important to ensure that
the groups have the correct policies defined. We'll cover creating policies in
the next section.

<Alert color="warning">
  Each user is automatically placed in the special `Everyone` group upon
  creation.
