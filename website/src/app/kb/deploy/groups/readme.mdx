# Create Groups

</PlanBadge>

Groups form the basis of the Firezone access control model. They are used to
organize Users and Service Accounts into a single context you can apply
[Policies](/kb/deploy/policies) to.

Groups can be created by going to `Groups -> Add Group` and then entering an
appropriate name for the group.

<Alert color="info">
  Automatic group sync is available for Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra ID,
  and Okta providers with the Enterprise plan. [Read more](/kb/directory-sync)
  about how it works or [contact sales](/contact/sales) to upgrade.
</Alert>

Groups cannot be nested, but a user can be a member of multiple groups. This
allows you to create a flexible and powerful access control model without having
to manage a complex hierarchy of groups within Firezone.

<Alert color="warning">
  Firezone automatically maintains a special `Everyone` group that contains all
  of the users in your account. This group cannot be deleted or modified.
