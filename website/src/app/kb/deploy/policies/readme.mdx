# Create Policies

</PlanBadge>

Policies are what grant users access to Resources.

To define a Policy, go to `Policies` -> `Add Policy`.

Policies define a single Group access to a single Resource.

<Alert color="warning">
  **Note:** To preserve audit trails, Policy access cannot be changed once a
  Policy is created. Double-check to ensure the group and resource selected are
  correct before creating the Policy.
