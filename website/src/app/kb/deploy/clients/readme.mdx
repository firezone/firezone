# Distribute Clients

</PlanBadge>

Firezone provides native clients for all major platforms. Use these clients on
end-user devices, servers, and any other machine that needs access to your
protected Resources.

## Installation

See our [client app guides](/kb/client-apps) for basic installation and usage
instructions for the Firezone Client that are appropriate for all Firezone
users. Or continue reading below for [MDM](#provision-with-mdm) deployment and
[headless mode](#headless-mode-operation) instructions suited for Firezone
admins wishing to deploy the clients at scale across their organization.

## Provision with MDM

Provisioning the Firezone client onto end-user devices should work out of the
box using any of the major MDM vendors using the appropriate distribution method
below. If you find an exception, please
[open a GitHub issue](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/new/choose)
so we can prioritize appropriately.

| Platform           | Distribution Method                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Android / ChromeOS | The Android / ChromeOS client is available from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.firezone.android) and as a standalone APK from our [changelog page](/changelog). |
| Linux              | The headless and GUI Linux clients are available from our [changelog page](/changelog).                                                                                                                    |
| iOS                | The iOS client is available exclusively from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firezone/id6443661826).                                                                                   |
| macOS              | The macOS client is available either from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firezone/id6443661826) or as a [standalone distributable](/changelog) in both DMG and PKG formats.           |
| Windows            | The Windows client is available as a standalone MSI installer from our [changelog page](/changelog).                                                                                                       |

### Allowlisting the macOS System Extension

The macOS client version 1.4.0 and higher includes a System Extension that must
be enabled in order to function. For MDM-managed devices, the System Extension
can be allowlisted to eliminate the need for the user to perform this step
manually.

Follow one of the guides below for your MDM provider, using `47R2M6779T` as the
Team Identifier and `dev.firezone.firezone.network-extension` as the Bundle
Identifier:

### Configuring the Client

Use managed configurations to customize or enforce certain Client settings
across your workforce. In general, most settings are available for all
platforms, but some are platform-specific. The table below lists the available
managed configuration available and to which platforms they apply.

<Alert color="warning">
  Once a key has been set, the user **will not** be able to change that
  particular setting in the Client UI. To allow the user to change the setting,
  you must **unset** the key from the managed configuration. `` Seems like the
  better emphasis to me.

### Applying managed configuration

Applying managed configuration is generally platform-specific and performed
through your organization's MDM provider. For template files and other
platform-specific notes, use the following details:

<TabsGroup>
<TabsItem title="macOS" icon={FaApple}>

##### Step 1: Generate a .mobileconfig file

macOS configurations are applied as `.mobileconfig` provisioning profiles, which
can be created by popular profile creator tools, such as
[Apple Configurator](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator/welcome/mac)
or [iMazing Profile Editor](https://imazing.com/profile-editor). We recommend
using iMazing Profile Editor as it has built-in support for generating Firezone
profiles.

If you'd prefer to create the file manually, you can
[download an example profile here](/policy-templates/macos/examples/all-keys.mobileconfig).

##### Step 2: Apply the .mobileconfig file

Consult your MDM provider's documentation for how to apply a provisioning
profile to your macOS fleet. Links for some popular MDM providers are below:

- [Jamf Pro](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-current/page/Mobile_Device_Configuration_Profiles.html)
- [Kandji](https://support.kandji.io/kb/custom-profiles-overview)
- [JumpCloud](https://jumpcloud.com/support/create-mac-or-ios-mdm-custom-configuration-profile-policy)
- [Hexnode](https://www.hexnode.com/mobile-device-management/help/how-to-deploy-custom-configuration-profiles-to-macos-devices/)
- [InTune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/configuration/custom-settings-macos)

</TabsItem>
<TabsItem title="Windows" icon={FaWindows}>

On Windows, Firezone supports a variety of MDM-based configuration values. These
are all read from the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Firezone` registry
key when the Client starts.

<Alert color="warning">
  In order for changes to the configuration to be picked up, users need to
  restart the Windows Client.
</Alert>

### Microsoft Intune

To set a policy via Microsoft Intune, follow these steps:

1. Download the Firezone policy template:

- [Download admx](/policy-templates/windows/firezone.admx)
- [Download adml (en_US)](/policy-templates/windows/firezone_en-US.adml)

1. Go to the
   [device configuration](https://intune.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Intune_DeviceSettings/DevicesMenu/~/configuration)
   in the Intune admin center.
1. Select "Import ADMX" and import the downloaded template files.
1. If you have previously imported the Firezone template, you'll need to remove
   the current one first before uploading an updated one. This is a Microsoft
   Intune limitation and might be resolved in the future. See
   [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/intune-service/configuration/administrative-templates-import-custom#replace-existing-admx-files)
   for details.
1. Once successful, select the "Policies" tab and click on "Create" -> "New
   policy"
1. For "Platform" select "Windows 10 or later" and for "Profile type" select
   "Templates".
1. From the list, select "Imported Administrative templates (Preview)" as the
   template name.
1. Go through the wizard, you can select from all available configuration
   settings for Firezone on the 2nd step.

</TabsGroup>

## Headless mode operation

The Firezone Client can run in headless mode on Windows, Linux, Android, and
ChromeOS platforms using a [Service Account](/kb/authenticate/service-accounts)
token. This mode is useful for deploying the Client on servers, IoT devices, and
other headless devices where a user may not be present to keep the Client
authenticated.

See the table below for achieving headless mode operation on each platform:

| Platform           | Headless Mode Operation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Android / ChromeOS | Set the `token` key using an MDM provider that supports Android [managed configurations](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-configurations). If the token is set and valid, Firezone will automatically connect and authenticate using this token when the Client is started. |
| Linux              | See the [Linux Headless Client](/kb/client-apps/linux-headless-client) guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| macOS / iOS        | Not yet supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Windows            | See the [Windows Headless Client](/kb/client-apps/windows-headless-client) guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
