# Deploy Gateways

</PlanBadge>

Gateways are what Clients connect to in order to access Resources in a Site.
They're the data plane workhorse of the Firezone architecture and are
responsible for securely routing traffic between Clients and Resources.

## Prerequisites

- Any Linux distribution with kernel 3.10 or later
- `x86_64`, `aarch64`, or `armv7l` CPU architecture
- `iptables` and `ip6tables` commands available on your system
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) or
  [systemd](https://systemd.io/) installed for your distribution

{/* The header `firewall-ports` is referenced in code */}

### Firewall ports

Gateways implement the industry-standard
[STUN](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8489) and
[TURN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8155.html) protocols to perform secure
NAT holepunching. This allows Firezone to establish direct connections between
your Users and Resources while keeping your Resources invisible to the public
internet.

#### Inbound ports

In most cases, **no inbound firewall ports should be opened** for Gateways to
function properly. If your network has a stateless firewall in place, however,
you'll need to ensure UDP return traffic can reach the Gateway(s). If you're not
sure, you should err on the side of caution and leave all inbound ports closed
unless you experience connectivity issues.

See the table below for firewall recommendations for popular cloud providers.

| Provider | Resource type                                                                                                       | Type      | Inbound ports                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

#### Outbound ports

If the network in which your Gateway is deployed applies egress filtering,
you'll need to make sure the following outbound traffic is allowed:

| Host                         | IP Address                            | Port(s)       | Protocol(s)     | Purpose                                                         |

#### Permissions

In order to function correctly, Gateways need access to several parts of the
Linux system:

1. The TUN device as `/dev/net/tun`
1. Permissions to open new UDP sockets
1. Permissions to add and remove routes via `netlink`

Typically, it is enough to run Gateways with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability.
Alternatively, you can run them as `root`.

Gateways will check on startup for these two conditions and fail if neither are
met. You can skip these permission checks by passing `--no-check`. This is only
advisable in case you have configured access in ways not covered by these
checks.

## Where to deploy Gateways

Ideally, Gateways should be deployed as close to the Resources they're serving
-- in some cases, even on the same host. This ensures the lowest possible
latency and highest possible throughput for Client connections, and allows you
to more easily deploy additional Gateways for other Resources that need to
handle more Client connections.

The downside of deploying Gateways close to Resources is that it increases the
overall number of Gateways and Sites you need to manage. Firezone's control
plane is designed to make this as easy as possible, but it's still something to
keep in mind when planning your deployment.

<Alert color="warning">
  When deploying Gateways, remember that all Gateways and Resources in a Site
  must have unobstructed network connectivity to each other. This is necessary
  for Firezone's automatic failover and load balancing features to work
  correctly.
</Alert>

### Sizing recommendations

The Gateway, like the rest of Firezone's data plane stack, is
[written in Rust](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/tree/main/rust/gateway).
As a result, it's extremely lightweight and computationally efficient by nature.

Gateways are mostly performance-bound by the I/O rate at which they can process
packets, so bare metal deployments or VMs with high I/O rates will make a big
difference in both throughput and latency.

Despite this, even tiny, shared vCPU VMs can perform acceptably well in many
cases. An `f1-micro` instance with just 0.25 vCPU cores on Google Cloud, for
example, can handle around 200 Mbps of sustained throughput.

| Gateway size | Approx. users served | CPU cores | Memory | Recommended link speed |
| ------------ | -------------------- | --------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Micro        | 10 - 50              | 1         | 512 MB | 500 Mbps               |
| Small        | 50 - 100             | 2         | 1 GB   | 1 Gbps                 |
| Medium       | 100 - 500            | 4         | 2 GB   | 2.5 Gbps               |

To go beyond the table above, you can deploy additional Gateways and use
Firezone's
[automatic load balancing](/kb/architecture/critical-sequences#high-availability)
to distribute Client connections across them.

### Performance tuning

The default receive buffer size on Linux is quite small which can limit the
maximum throughput that users perceive in "upload scenarios" (i.e. where the
Gateway needs to receive large volumes of traffic).

On startup, the Gateway attempts to increase the size of the UDP receive buffers
to 10 MB. However, the actual size of the receive buffer is limited by the
`net.core.rmem_max` kernel parameter. For the increased buffer size to take
effect, you may need to increase the `net.core.rmem_max` parameter on the
Gateway's host system.

## Deploy a single Gateway

Deploying a single Gateway can be accomplished in the admin portal.

<Alert color="warning">
  We **strongly** recommend deploying a minimum of three Gateways in a Site for
  production use cases. This ensures high availability even when performing
  rolling upgrades.
</Alert>

Go to `Sites -> <name of Site> -> Deploy a Gateway` and follow the prompts to
deploy for your preferred environment. This will deploy a single Gateway.

## Deploy multiple Gateways

To achieve
[high availability](/kb/architecture/critical-sequences#high-availability),
deploy two or more Gateways within the same Site. High availability is achieved
through a combination of automatic failover and load balancing, both of which
are available on all plans.

You can deploy multiple Gateways within a Site manually from the admin portal,
or automate the process by reusing the `FIREZONE_TOKEN` environment variable
shown on the `Manual` tab of the `Deploy a new Gateway` page. This is a
multi-owner token that can be reused to deploy multiple Gateways within the same
Site.

<Alert color="warning">
  **Note:** Be sure to set a unique `FIREZONE_ID` for each Gateway you deploy.
  This can be any non-empty string and is used to identify Gateways in the
  portal.
</Alert>

Deploy as many Gateways as you need to handle the load of Client connections to
Resources in a Site. This effectively shards Client connections across all
Gateways in a Site, achieving higher overall throughput than otherwise possible
with a single Gateway.

### Automated Gateway deployment

See [our automation recipes](/kb/automate) for deploying Gateways on various
cloud providers using Terraform.

### Keeping Gateways up to date

It's a good idea to keep your Gateways up to date with the latest version
available. See [upgrading Gateways](/kb/administer/upgrading) for ways to
automate this.

## Telemetry

By default, Gateways will run a https://sentry.io crash-reporting agent. If
you'd like to opt-out of this, set the environment variable
`FIREZONE_NO_TELEMETRY=true`.
