# Deploy a Gateway

This guide covers deployment of the Firezone gateway.

Gateways expect to have unobstructed network-level access to resources within
the same site.

## Prerequisites

- Any Linux distribution with kernel 5.0 or higher
- Docker Engine (for docker-based installs)
- Systemd (for systemd-based installs)

## Resource considerations

Gateways, like the rest of Firezone's data plane stack, are written in Rust and
are thus resource efficient by nature. A single gateway running on a 2 vCPU VM
with 1 GB of memory should be able to handle hundreds of client connections
under typical usage patterns.

Network throughput is usually constrained by single-thread performance due to
the WireGuard state machine and overhead in the kernel network stack. Still,
most gateways should be able to saturate 1 Gbps with relative ease. Faster
speeds can be achieved with syscall optimization and multi-threaded
optimizations, both of which are currently being worked on.

## Deploy a single gateway

Deployed a single gateway can be accomplished in the admin portal.

Go to `Sites` -> `<site>` -> `Deploy a Gateway` and follow the prompts to deploy
for your preferred environment. This will deploy a single gateway.

See the [upgrading guide](/kb/administer/upgrading) for information on keeping
your gateway up-to-date.

## Deploy multiple gateways

When deploying a gateway from the admin portal, a `FIREZONE_TOKEN` environment
variable is shown. This variable can be reused to deploy multiple gateways
within the same site.

This means you can automate deployment of the gateway using your automation
method of choice, adding as many gateways as necessary for failover and load
balancing.

    gateway you deploy. This can be any non-empty string and is used to
    identify the gateway in the portal for audit trail and logging purposes.

## Failover

Two or more Gateways deployed in the same site will automatically fail over and
load balance for each other.

When the portal detects a particular gateway is unhealthy, it will stop using it
for new connection requests to resources in the site. Fail over takes around 60
to 120 seconds for clients to time out their existing gateway connections and
fail over to a healthy one. During this time, connection to resources will be
interrupted, so it's important to plan gateway downtime appropriately.

## Load balancing

Load balancing happens automatically each time a client requests a connection to
a resource and uses a round-robin approach which selects a random gateway in the
site to serve the resource being requested.

This effectively shards client connections across all gateways in a site,
achieving higher overall throughput than otherwise possible with a single
gateway.
