# Configure DNS

</PlanBadge>

Firezone includes a sophisticated DNS routing system available on all plans that
provides Split DNS and fallback resolver configuration for each Firezone Client.
Read more below to understand how it works and how to configure it.

## How DNS works in Firezone

Each Firezone Client embeds a lightweight DNS resolver used to route queries to
an appropriate Gateway for resolution.

When a user signs in, the Client configures the host operating system to use
this resolver as the default resolver for all queries on the system.

This is why you'll commonly see `100.100.111.1` or
`fd00:2021:1111:8000::100:100:111:0` as the DNS server responding to DNS queries
when the Firezone Client is signed in.

### How queries are resolved

<Alert color="info">
  DNS resolution is explained in detail in the [Firezone architecture
  docs](/kb/architecture/critical-sequences#dns-resolution).
</Alert>

When the resolver sees a DNS query for a Resource, it generates a mapped, dummy
IP and responds with that IP. The mapped IP is used to route traffic
corresponding to the Resource in question to a healthy Gateway. While this is
happening, the Gateway receives the query via the control plane and resolves it
using its system resolver, storing the result in a lookup table.

When the Gateway sees traffic coming from the Client for the mapped IP, it
translates the mapped IP back to the actual IP address of the Resource and
forwards the traffic to the Resource.

This happens in a fraction of a second and is completely transparent to the end
user. The Client host's system resolver is never used for resolving DNS queries
for Firezone Resources, and never sees the actual IP addresses of DNS Resources
in your account, ensuring your DNS data remains private and secure.

For example, if `github.com` was added as a Resource, an `nslookup` might return
`100.96.0.1` as its IPv4 address:

```text
> nslookup github.com
Server:  100.100.111.1
Address: 100.100.111.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	github.com
Address: 100.96.0.1
```

If the query doesn't match a Resource, the resolver forwards the query to one of
the [upstream resolvers](#configuring-client-dns-upstream-resolvers) if
configured in your account. Otherwise, it forwards the query to the default
system resolver on the Client host.

<Alert color="warning">

Queries forwarded to upstream resolvers are **never** routed through Firezone
unless (1) you've defined custom upstream resolver(s) below, and (2) those
resolvers are defined as Resources in your account. This ensures that queries
for Firezone infrastructure and services on the Client's local LAN continue to
be resolvable even if the Client's DHCP-provided DNS server collides with an IP
or CIDR Resource in your account.

</Alert>

<Alert color="info">

Firezone only intercepts queries for the `A`, `AAAA`, `PTR`, `SRV` and `TXT`
record types for your DNS Resources. All other record types are forwarded to the
upstream resolver(s).

</Alert>

## Configuring search domains

A search domain (sometimes known as a default DNS suffix) can be configured with
the domain name of your choosing in the `Settings -> DNS` page. This domain will
automatically be appended to **all single-label queries on the system** when a
Client device is signed into Firezone.

<Alert color="warning">

On Apple devices, the search domain set in the Firezone admin portal is applied
_in addition_ to any locally-configured search domains. On Android, Linux, and
Windows devices, however, these are applied _instead of_ any locally-configured
search domains. If this is causing an issue for your use case, please leave
feedback on
[this GitHub issue](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/8430).

</Alert>

## Configuring Client DNS

Go to `Settings -> DNS` to configure how Firezone Clients should resolve DNS.

### Default system resolvers

By default, Firezone Clients will use the system resolvers, typically set by the
DHCP server of their local network.

### Secure DNS

<Alert color="info">
  Secure DNS was added in the following client versions:
  - **macOS**: 1.5.10
  - **iOS**: 1.5.10
  - **Android**: 1.5.7
  - **Windows GUI**: 1.5.9
  - **Windows Headless**: 1.5.9
  - **Linux Headless**: 1.5.9
</Alert>

Firezone Clients can use the DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) protocol for all non-Firezone
resources. Secure DNS encrypts all DNS traffic, preventing middleboxes
(including ISPs) from seeing or manipulating DNS traffic. This is especially
useful on insecure or untrusted networks.

You can choose from several trusted DoH providers:

- **Google Public DNS**: Google's public DNS service
- **Cloudflare DNS**: Cloudflare's privacy-focused DNS service
- **Quad9 DNS**: Security and privacy-focused DNS service
- **OpenDNS**: Cisco's OpenDNS service

To enable Secure DNS, go to `Settings -> DNS` in the admin portal and select
the "Secure DNS" option, then choose your preferred DoH provider.

### Custom resolvers

Upstream DNS in all Clients can be configured with the servers of your choosing
so that all queries on Client devices will be forwarded to the servers you
specify for all non-Firezone resources.

<Alert color="warning">
  When setting custom upstream resolvers, it is **highly** recommended to
  configure **both** an IPv4 and IPv6 option. Otherwise, a Client that has only
  IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity may not be able to resolve DNS queries.
</Alert>

## Configuring Gateway resolvers

Firezone makes no assumptions about the DNS environment in which the Gateway
runs. It uses the default system resolver you've configured on the Gateway host,
typically defined in `/etc/resolv.conf`.

This resolver is used for DNS Resources defined in your Firezone account so it's
important that your Gateway host has DNS configured properly for Clients to
resolve names successfully.
