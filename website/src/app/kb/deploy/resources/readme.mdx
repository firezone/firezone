# Create Resources

</PlanBadge>

Resources define subnets, IP addresses, or DNS names you wish to manage access
for.

To create a Resource, go to `Sites -> <site name> -> Add a Resource`.

<Alert color="info">
  Remember, Resources **must** be reachable by all Gateways in the same Site.
</Alert>

From there, you can select the type of Resource you want to create:

- **DNS**: A domain name pattern to match.
  - By default, the pattern will only match the exact name you enter.
  - To match all subdomains recursively, use a double-wildcard, such as
    `**.example.com`. This will match `example.com`, `sub.example.com`, and
    `sub.sub.example.com`.
  - To match all subdomains non-recursively, use a single wildcard, such as
    `*.example.com`. This will match `sub.example.com` but not
    `sub.sub.example.com`.
  - To match a single character, use a question mark, such as
    `us-east?.example.com`. This will match `us-east1.example.com` but not
    `us-eastXY.example.com`.
  - Wildcards can be placed between domain components, e.g., `foo.*.example.com`
    will match `foo.bar.example.com` or `foo.**.example.com` will match
    `foo.bar.baz.example.com`.
- **IP**: A single IPv4 or IPv6 address
- **CIDR**: A range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in CIDR notation, such as
  `10.1.2.0/24` or `2001:db8::/48`

<Alert color="warning">
  **Note:** Once a Resource is created, its address cannot be changed.
  Double-check to ensure the address entered is correct before creating the
  Resource.
</Alert>

#### Routing order for overlapping addresses

When multiple Resources' addresses overlap, the Resource with the more specific
address will be used.

For CIDR Resources, an address with a longer prefix is more specific than a
shorter one. For example: `10.0.0.0/16` is more specific than `10.0.0.0/8`. IP
Resources are essentially addresses with `/32` prefix and thus always more
specific than any other CIDR.

For DNS Resources, more specific loosely translates to less wildcards. In
particular:

- Resources without wildcards are always prioritized over wildcard domains: For
  example, `app.example.com` is checked before `*.example.com`.
- Single-char wildcards (`?`) take priority over label wildcards (`*`): For
  example, `???.example.com` is checked before `*.example.com`.
- Label wildcards (`*`) take priority over catch-all wildcards (`**`): For
  example, `*.example.com` is checked before `**.example.com`.

### Address description

When creating a Resource, you'll be given the option to add an
`address_description`. If given, this will be displayed in the Client's Resource
list to help identify the Resource. If a URL is entered, it will be displayed as
a clickable link.

<Link
  target="_blank"
  href="/images/kb/deploy/resources/address_description.png"
>
  <Image
    src="/images/kb/deploy/resources/address_description.png"
    alt="Address description field"
    width={600}
    height={600}
    className="mx-auto"
  />
</Link>

This is commonly used to show a different address to end users than the one used
for routing, where field validations are more restrictive. This can be useful to
provide a bookmark to a service like `https://gitlab.company.com`, or give hints
for accessing the service, like `10.0.0.1:2222`.

### IP stack

</PlanBadge>

<Alert color="info">

Introduced in macOS 1.5.2, iOS 1.5.2, Android 1.5.0, Windows 1.5.0, and Linux
1.5.0.

</Alert>

The **IP stack** setting for DNS Resources controls the types of DNS records
(`A` for IPv4, `AAAA` for IPv6) generated by the
[stub resolver](/kb/architecture/critical-sequences#dns-resolution).

- **Dual-stack (Default):** Generates both `A` and `AAAA` records.
- **IPv4 only:** Generates only `A` records.
- **IPv6 only:** Generates only `AAAA` records.

This setting primarily enhances compatibility with applications that might not
properly handle **ICMP unreachable errors**. These errors are typically sent by
the Gateway to indicate that the requested IP stack (e.g., IPv6) does not have
corresponding `A` or `AAAA` records for a connection attempt.

Since some applications don't gracefully handle these errors, configuring the IP
stack to `IPv4 only` or `IPv6 only` can mitigate such issues by ensuring only
available records are returned.

If you're unsure, it's generally recommended to leave this setting at
**Dual-stack**.

### Traffic restrictions

</PlanBadge>

  className="mx-auto shadow-sm rounded-sm"
/>

You can specify optional port range(s) and protocols on the Resource for finer
access control, useful for restricting certain services while allowing others.
Supported protocols currently include `ICMP`, `TCP`, and `UDP`.

One popular use case for traffic restrictions is segmenting access to individual
services on a host. To do this, simply create a Resource for each service on the
host you want to allow access to, and add the appropriate traffic restrictions
to each one.

For example, create an Resource with the `TCP/22` restriction to allow SSH
access for your DevOps team, then add another Resource with the `TCP/443`
restriction to allow access to an HTTPS service for the rest of your
organization.

### The Internet Resource

</PlanBadge>

The Internet Resource is a special Resource available on paid plans that allows
you to route `0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0` through Firezone in a full-tunnel
configuration. It functions as a fallback for traffic that doesn't match any
other Resource.

<Alert color="warning">
  Unlike regular Resources, the Internet Resource can be disabled by end-users
  to prevent their internet access from being affected by Firezone if any issues
  arise. The Internet Resource is <strong>disabled by default</strong> in Client
  apps when it is first assigned a policy.
</Alert>

The Internet Resource is automatically enabled on Team and Enterprise plans. To
use it, head to the main `Sites` section in the admin portal, and look for the
`Manage Internet Resource` in the section at the bottom of the page.

This will take you to the Internet Site, a special system-managed Site dedicated
to hosting the Internet Resource. Here you can deploy Gateways and manage
Policies like any other Site.

<Alert color="info">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Deploy geographically-dispersed Gateways to the Internet
  Site to provide lower latency for a remote workforce. Firezone automatically
  selects the closest Gateway to route traffic through.
