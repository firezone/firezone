# Service Accounts

</PlanBadge>

Service accounts are actors that can be used with Firezone Clients that support
headless mode operation. They are commonly used for situations where you want to
manage access from a server, machine, IoT device, or other non-user machine to
your Resources.

Service accounts behave like any other actor in Firezone. They can be added to
Groups and Policies to gain access to Resources.

Unlike users, however, service accounts must be managed manually and are never
synced from your identity provider.

<Alert color="warning">
  Because service accounts authenticate to your Firezone account without user
  interaction, their tokens have a **1-year** expiration by default. This can be
  changed when creating the service account.
</Alert>

## Create a service account

To create a service account, head to `Actors` -> `Add Actor` and select
`Service Account` as the type.

On the next screen, set an appropriate expiration date for the token.

You will then be shown a token you'll need to store somewhere safe. This token
can then be used with Firezone Clients that support
[headless mode operation](/kb/deploy/clients#headless-mode-operation).

You can add as many tokens as you like to a service account, and you can revoke
them at any time.
