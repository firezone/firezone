# Service Accounts

</PlanBadge>

Service accounts are non-user actors used for authentication where no user is
physically present to perform a standard identity provider authentication flow.
They are commonly used for managing access from servers, machines, IoT devices,
or other non-user machines to your Resources, as well as for programmatic or
automated access from GUI clients.

Service accounts behave like any other actor in Firezone -- they can be added to
Groups and Policies to gain access to Resources. Unlike users, however, service
accounts must be managed manually and are never synced from your identity
provider.

## Creating a service account

To create a service account:

1. Navigate to `Actors -> Add Actor` in your Firezone admin portal
1. Select `Service Account` as the type
1. Set an appropriate expiration for the initial token
1. Copy and store the token somewhere safe -- it will only be shown once

The token can then be used with any Firezone Client, including
[headless clients](/kb/deploy/clients#headless-mode-operation) and GUI clients
(macOS, Android, iOS, Windows, Linux).

## Managing tokens

Service account tokens authenticate directly to the Firezone API using
long-lived, multi-owner tokens. A single token can be used by multiple clients
simultaneously, making them ideal for fleets of machines or multiple devices
that need the same access.

Service account tokens are managed entirely in the Firezone admin portal and are
**not affected** by identity provider configuration or session lifetime
settings.

<Alert color="warning">
  Service account tokens have a default lifetime of **365 days**. Choose an
  appropriate expiration based on your security requirements.

### Adding tokens

You can add multiple tokens to a service account. This is useful for rotating
tokens or providing separate tokens to different systems.

To add a token:

1. Navigate to `Actors` in the left sidebar of your Firezone admin portal
1. Click the service account you wish to add a token for
1. Click the hamburger menu (three vertical dots) in the top right corner
1. Select `Add Token` from the dropdown menu

### Revoking tokens

Tokens can be revoked at any time from the service account's detail page. Click
the trash icon next to the token you wish to revoke.
