# How Directory Sync Works

</PlanBadge>

Firezone supports automatic directory sync from Google Workspace, Microsoft
Entra ID, and Okta. This feature is **automatically enabled** when you create
one of the [Google Workspace](/kb/authenticate/google),
[Microsoft Entra](/kb/authenticate/entra), or [Okta](/kb/authenticate/okta)
connectors. Once the connector is activated, users, groups, and organizational
units will be synced from your identity provider every few minutes.

## Role mapping

All synced users are assigned the unprivileged `User` role by default. This role
is allowed to sign in from the Firezone Client, but has no access to the admin
portal. If you need to grant a synced user access to the admin portal, you can
manually assign the user the `Admin` role by going to
`Actors -> <actor name> -> Edit User` and updating their role appropriately.

Automatic role mapping is not currently supported. If this is a feature you
would like to see, please let us know by
[leaving a comment](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/5931) on our
GitHub issue tracker.

## How Firezone treats deleted entities

When you delete a user or group in your identity provider, Firezone soft-deletes
them upon the next sync. This prevents data duplication if a user or group is
only temporarily suspended, and helps preserve logged activity within Firezone
for auditing purposes.

### Deleting or suspending a user

When a user is deleted or suspended in your identity provider, Firezone will
delete the associated identity the user signs in with, clearing all active
Client and admin portal web sessions for that identity. The user will be
immediately **signed out of all Client and admin portal sessions**.

This ensures terminated employees will have all Firezone access revoked within a
few minutes of deleting or suspending them in your identity provider.

### Deleting a group or organizational unit

When a group or organizational unit is deleted in your identity provider,
Firezone will delete the group and all associated Policies. Any access granted
by those Policies **will be immediately revoked**.

## Nested groups and organizational units

Firezone syncs nested (sometimes called "transitive") memberships from your
identity provider. This means user membership for a particular group is
determined not only by its immediate members, but any child groups as well. This
allows you to create nested group structures in your identity provider and have
their memberships automatically reflected in Firezone.

For example, if you had the following group structure in your identity provider:

```yaml
Everyone:
  - steve@company.com
  Support:
    - patrick@company.com
  Engineering:
    - bob@company.com
    - alice@company.com
    Devops:
      - john@company.com
```

You would see the following group memberships in Firezone after sync:

```yaml
Group:Everyone:
  - steve@company.com
  - patrick@company.com
  - bob@company.com
  - alice@company.com
  - john@company.com
Group:Engineering:
  - bob@company.com
  - alice@company.com
  - john@company.com
Group:Support:
  - patrick@company.com
Group:DevOps:
  - john@company.com
```
