# SSO with JumpCloud

</PlanBadge>

Firezone integrates with [JumpCloud](https://www.jumpcloud.com) using a custom
connector that supports both authentication and directory sync. Use this guide
if you're looking to setup SSO with JumpCloud for your Firezone account and
optionally sync users and groups from JumpCloud to Firezone.

<Alert color="info">
  Directory sync is supported for the **Enterprise** plan only.
</Alert>

## Overview

The JumpCloud connector uses OpenID Connect for authentication and JumpCloud's
SCIM API to optionally support directory sync on Enterprise plans.

When directory sync is enabled, users and groups are synced every few minutes to
ensure that your Firezone account remains up-to-date with the latest identity
data from JumpCloud. [Read more](/kb/authenticate/directory-sync) about how sync
works.

## Setup

Setting up the JumpCloud connector is similar to the process of setting up a
universal OIDC connector. The main difference is omission of the
`Discovery Document URI` configuration field, as this is the same for all
JumpCloud tenants.

Follow the steps below to setup the JumpCloud connector.

### Step 1: Start the JumpCloud provider setup in Firezone

In your admin portal, go to `Settings -> Identity Providers` and click
`Add Identity Provider`. Then, select `JumpCloud` from the list of identity
providers.

You'll be shown a summary of the steps you need to complete to setup the
JumpCloud provider. Keep this page open as you'll need to refer to it in the
following steps.

### Step 2: Create a new SSO application in JumpCloud

[Login to your JumpCloud admin portal](https://console.jumpcloud.com/login),
click **SSO Applications** and then **+ Add New Application**.

  target="_blank"
>
  <Image
    src="/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/1-add-application.png"
    alt="SSO Applications"
    width={1200}
    height={1200}
  />
</Link>

Select **Custom Application** and click **Next**.

<Link
  href="/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/2-custom-application.png"
  target="_blank"
>
  <Image
    src="/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/2-custom-application.png"
    alt="Custom Application"
    width={1200}
    height={1200}
  />
</Link>

On the next screen, ensure **Manage Single Sign-On** is selected, and select the
**Configure SSO with OIDC** option.

Optionally, select **Export users to this app (Identity Management)** if you
plan to set up directory sync for this connector.

Click **Next**.

  target="_blank"
>
  <Image
    src="/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/3-select-options.png"
    alt="Select options"
    width={1200}
    height={1200}
  />
</Link>

On the next screen, enter `Firezone` for the **Display Label**.

Choose **Logo** for the User Portal Image and use this link to download an
appropriate logo to use for the app registration:

- [https://www.firezone.dev/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/jumpcloud-oauth-screen-logo.png](https://www.firezone.dev/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/jumpcloud-oauth-screen-logo.png)

Then click **Next**.

<Link
  href="/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/4-configure-application.png"
  target="_blank"
>
  <Image
    src="/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/4-configure-application.png"
    alt="Configure application"
    width={1200}
    height={1200}
  />
</Link>

On the following screen, select the **User Groups** tab and choose which users
you'd like to grant access to Firezone.

<Link
  href="/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/5-select-user-groups.png"
  target="_blank"
>
  <Image
    src="/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/5-select-user-groups.png"
    alt="Select user groups"
    width={1200}
    height={1200}
  />
</Link>

Next, go back to the **SSO** tab and copy the two **Redirect URIs** shown in the
setup page from the Firezone admin portal and paste them here.

Use [https://app.firezone.dev/](https://app.firezone.dev) for the **Login URL**.

Then, under **Attribute Mapping**, make sure **Email** and **Profile** are both
checked under **Standard Scopes**. Leave the mappings as they are.

Then, click **Activate**.

<Link
  href="/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/6-enter-redirect-uris.png"
  target="_blank"
>
  <Image
    src="/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/6-enter-redirect-uris.png"
    alt="Enter redirect URIs"
    width={1200}
    height={1200}
  />
</Link>

You should now see a screen that says **Application Saved** with the **Client
ID** and **Client Secret**.

<Link
  href="/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/7-copy-client-details.png"
  target="_blank"
>
  <Image
    src="/images/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud/7-copy-client-details.png"
    alt="Enter redirect URIs"
    width={1200}
    height={1200}
  />
</Link>

**Important**: Make sure to save the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` fields in a
safe place as they won't be shown again.

### Step 3: Finish setting up the JumpCloud provider in Firezone

Go back to the setup page in the Firezone admin portal and enter the `Client ID`
and `Client Secret` values you copied from the JumpCloud application in the
previous step.

Then, click **Connect Identity Provider**.

If you get successfully redirected back to your Firezone admin portal, you're
done! Your JumpCloud connector is now ready to authenticate users.

If you'd like to enable directory sync, keep reading below.

### Step 4: Enable directory sync (optional)

</PlanBadge>

To enable directory sync, go to the JumpCloud provider you just created in the
Firezone admin portal. Click the **Setup Sync** button in the **Sync Status**
section of the **Details** pane.

You'll be taken through a detailed step-by-step guide to set up SCIM 2.0 with
JumpCloud. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully to ensure that the
sync is set up correctly.

<Alert color="warning">
  **Note**: Firezone uses [WorkOS](https://workos.com) behind the scenes to
  connect to JumpCloud's SCIM API. When setting up the SCIM integration, you'll
  be taken through WorkOS's setup flow hosted from the `setup.workos.com`
  domain. This is completely normal. You **do not** need to create a WorkOS
  account for this to function.
</Alert>

Once directory sync is enabled, users and groups will be synced every few
minutes to ensure that your Firezone account remains up-to-date with the latest
identity data from JumpCloud.

<Alert color="info">

Synced users will be assigned the `User` role by default, allowing them access
to sign in from the Firezone Client only. If you need to grant access to the
admin portal, you need to manually promote the user to the `Admin` role by
visiting `Actors -> <actor name> -> Edit User` and updating their role.
