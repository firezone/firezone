# Authentication

Firezone supports a wide variety of authentication providers, allowing you to
authenticate users against whatever identity provider you're already using. See
below for more in-depth guides for each supported provider:

1. [Email (OTP)](/kb/authenticate/email): Authenticate with a one-time passcode
   sent to a user's email.
1. [Google Workspace](/kb/authenticate/google): Authenticate users and
   optionally sync users and groups with Google Workspace.
1. [Microsoft Entra ID](/kb/authenticate/entra): Authenticate users and
   optionally sync users and groups with Microsoft Entra ID.
1. [Okta](/kb/authenticate/okta): Authenticate users and optionally sync users
   and groups with Okta.
1. [JumpCloud](/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud): Authenticate users and optionally
   sync users and groups with JumpCloud.
1. [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/kb/authenticate/oidc): Authenticate to any OpenID
   Connect provider using a universal OIDC connector.

It's possible to create multiple providers for the Google Workspace, Microsoft
Entra ID, Okta, JumpCloud, and OIDC connectors. This allows you to authenticate
users against multiple providers at the same time, each with different Groups
and Policies applied to them.

<Alert color="warning">
  Disabling the email provider can lock you out of your account in the event
  that all other identity providers become unusable. We recommend keeping at
  least one admin enabled for the email provider for account recovery. If you
  become locked out, [contact support](mailto:support@firezone.dev) for
  assistance.
</Alert>

## Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Firezone intentionally does not support multi-factor authentication (MFA)
directly. Instead, we recommend setting any required MFA steps in your identity
provider so you can apply a consistent MFA strategy for all of your
SSO-connected applications, not just Firezone.

Here are links to MFA setup guides for some popular identity providers:

- [Google Workspace](https://support.google.com/a/answer/184711)
- [Microsoft Entra ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-userstates)
- [Okta](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/mfa/mfa-home.htm)

## Session lifetime

Firezone uses a separate authentication session token for each component that
authenticates to either the Admin portal and the API. See the table below for
the session lifetimes of these tokens:

| Component           | Auth Provider                     | Lifetime                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin portal web UI | Email authentication              | **10 hours**                                                                |
| Admin portal web UI | OIDC and other identity providers | Copied from the OIDC access token lifetime, up to a maximum of **10 hours** |
| Client applications | All identity providers            | **2 weeks**                                                                 |
| Service accounts    | N/A                               | **365 days** by default, configurable per token                             |
| Gateways            | N/A                               | **Indefinitely**. Tokens must be explicitly revoked in the portal UI.       |

When a session token expires or is revoked, the affected component is
disconnected immediately and must reauthenticate to regain access to Resources.
This includes web UI sessions for admins.
