# SSO with Google Workspace

Firezone supports authenticating users to Google Workspace using our custom
Google Workspace connector. Use this guide if you're looking to setup SSO with
Google Workspace for your Firezone Enterprise account.

## Overview

The Firezone Google Workspace connector integrates with Google's identity APIs
to support user authentication and automatic user/group sync.

Users, groups, and organizational units are synced every few minutes to ensure
that your Firezone account remains up-to-date with the latest identity data from
your Google Workspace account.
[Read more about user / group sync here](/kb/authenticate/user-group-sync).

## Setup

To set up the Google workspace connector, go to `Settings` ->
`Identity Providers` -> `Add Identity Provider` and follow the prompts from
there.

Setting up the Google Workspace connector is similar to the process of setting
up a universal OIDC connector. The main difference is the addition of a few
extra scopes needed to enable user/group sync.
