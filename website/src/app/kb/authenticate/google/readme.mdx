# SSO with Google Workspace

Firezone supports authenticating users to Google Workspace using our custom
Google Workspace connector. Use this guide if you're looking to setup SSO with
Google Workspace for your Firezone Enterprise account.

    Google Workspace integration is available in the Enterprise plan.
    To authenticate users to your Google Workspace account in the Starter
    plan <strong>without</strong> automatic user/group sync, use our

      universal OIDC connector
    </a> instead.
  `}
/>

## Overview

The Firezone Google Workspace connector integrates with Google's identity APIs
to support user authentication and user / group sync.

Users, groups, and organizational units are synced every few minutes to ensure
that your Firezone account remains up-to-date with the latest identity data from
your Google Workspace account.
[Read more about user / group sync here](/kb/authenticate/user-group-sync).

## Setup

Setting up the Google Workspace connector is similar to the process of setting
up a universal OIDC connector. The main difference is the addition of a few
extra scopes needed to enable user/group sync.

To setup the Google Workspace connector, follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Create a new project in Google Cloud

<Alert

  html={`
    You may skip this step and proceed directly to
    <a href="#step-2-enable-the-admin-sdk-api" class="hover:underline text-accent-500">
    Step 2</a> if you already have a GCP project you'd like to use with Firezone.
  `}
/>

[Go here to create a new project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
in your Google Cloud account and fill in the following fields:

- **Project name**: `Firezone Connector`
- **Organization**: Select the appropriate organization that contains the users
  and groups you wish to integrate with Firezone.
- **Location**: Select the appropriate organization to place this project under.

Click **CREATE** after you've filled in the fields above.

/>

### Step 2: Enable the Admin SDK API

[Visit this link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/admin.googleapis.com)
to enable the Admin SDK API for the project you just created in Step 1.

**Important**: Ensure the **Firezone Connector** project you created in Step 1
is selected before clicking the "ENABLE" button.

  src="/images/gcp-enable-admin-api.png"
  alt="Enable Admin SDK API"
  width={1200}
  height={1200}
/>

### Step 3: Configure the OAuth consent screen

[Click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) to
configure the OAuth consent screen for the project you created in Step 1.

**Important**: Select "Internal" for User type. Select "External" may allow
external users to login to your Firezone account.

<Image
  src="/images/gcp-oauth-consent-screen.png"
  alt="Enable Admin SDK API"
  width={1200}
  height={1200}
/>

Click **CREATE**.

On the next page, enter the following information:

- **App name**: `Firezone`
- **User support email**: Your or your company's IT support email address.
- **App logo** (optional):
  [Download the Firezone logo here](/images/gcp-oauth-screen-logo.png) to use
  for this consent screen.
- **Application home page**: `https://www.firezone.dev`
- **Application privacy policy link**: `https://www.firezone.dev/privacy-policy`
- **Application terms of service link**: `https://www.firezone.dev/terms`
- **Authorized domains**: Click "ADD DOMAIN" and enter `firezone.dev`
- **Developer contact information**: Enter the same email you used above, e.g.
  `it-support@company.com`

<Image
  src="/images/gcp-oauth-screen-2.png"
  alt="Add app info"
  width={1200}
  height={1200}
/>

Click **SAVE AND CONTINUE**.

### Step 4: Configure scopes

OAuth scopes determine what information the Firezone connector is allowed to
receive when a user authenticates. Firezone requires the following scopes to
authenticate users and sync users and groups with your Google Workspace account:

- `openid`: Reserved scope required by all OpenID Connect integrations.
- `profile`: Provides information such as the user's username, given name,
  surname, and so forth.
- `email`: The user's email address.
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.orgunit.readonly`: Required
  to sync Organization Units.
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly`: Required to
  sync Groups.
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly`: Required to
  sync Users.

```text
openid
profile
email
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.orgunit.readonly
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly
```

Click **ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES** and copy-paste the above scopes into the
**Manually add scopes** field.

<Image
  src="/images/gcp-update-scopes.png"
  alt="Update scopes"
  width={1200}
  height={1200}
/>

Then click **UPDATE** to make sure they're applied.

  width={1200}
  height={1200}
/>

<Image
  src="/images/gcp-scopes-continue.png"
  alt="Scopes continue"
  width={1200}
  height={1200}
/>

Ensure your Scopes configuration looks like the screenshot above, then click
**SAVE AND CONTINUE**.

<Image
  src="/images/gcp-oauth-summary.png"
  alt="Scopes continue"
  width={1200}
  height={1200}
/>

Your OAuth app summary should look similar to the screenshot above.

### Step 5: Create client credentials

Next, you'll need to add OAuth credentials to allow Firezone to connect to your
Google Workspace account.

Head to
[the Credentials section](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) and
click **CREATE CREDENTIALS** to create new OAuth credentials. Be sure to select
"OAuth client ID" in the dropdown menu.

<Image
  src="/images/gcp-create-credentials.png"
  alt="Create OAuth credentials"
  width={1200}
  height={1200}
/>

On the next screen, select **Web application**, then use the following
information for the remain fields:

- **Name**: `Firezone OAuth Client`
- **Authorized redirect URIs**: Click **ADD URI**, and enter the two redirect
  URIs shown on the Google Workspace identity provider setup screen in your
  Firezone admin dashboard
  (`Settings -> Identity Providers -> Add Identity Provider -> Google Workspace -> Configure`).

<Image
  src="/images/gcp-creds-web.png"
  alt="Web application credentials"
  width={1200}
  height={1200}
/>

Click **CREATE**.

<Image
  src="/images/gcp-oauth-credentials.png"
  alt="Web application credentials"
  width={1200}
  height={1200}
/>

**Important**: Make sure to save the `Client ID` and `Client secret` fields in a
safe place as they won't be shown again.

### Step 6: Enter `Client ID` and `Client secret` in Firezone

Go back to the Firezone admin dashboard, and enter the `Client ID` and
`Client secret` you copied from the previous step in the appropriate fields in
"Create Identity Provider" form.

Finally, click **Connect Identity Provider** and click **Allow** when Google
prompts you.

<Image
  src="/images/gcp-allow.png"
  alt="Allow admin access"
  width={400}
  height={400}
  className="mx-auto"
/>

If you get successfully redirected back to your Firezone admin dashboard, you're
done! Your Google Workspace connector is now successfully configured. Users in
your organization can now authenticate to Firezone using this connector and user
/ group sync will occur every few minutes.
