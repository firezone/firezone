# SSO with OpenID Connect

</PlanBadge>

Firezone supports authenticating users with a universal OIDC connector that
works with any authentication service offering a standard
[OIDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID) authentication mechanism. Use this
connector to enable authenticating users and admins to Firezone for any
OIDC-capable identity provider that supports the `authorization_code` grant.

<Alert color="warning">
  Directory sync is **not supported** with the universal OIDC connector. See the
  [Google Workspace](/kb/authenticate/google), [Microsoft Entra
  ID](/kb/authenticate/entra), or [Okta](/kb/authenticate/okta) connectors for
  automatic directory sync. You'll need to manually create and manage users and
  groups for use with the universal OIDC connector.
</Alert>

For Firezone-specific instructions for a given provider, select your provider in
the list below:

- [Fusion Auth](/kb/authenticate/oidc/fusion)

Fo others, consult your provider's documentation for setting up an OpenID
Connect client. Here's a list of popular providers with links to their OIDC
documentation for convenience:

- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/application-settings)
- [Onelogin](https://onelogin.service-now.com/support?id=kb_article&sys_id=2fd988e697b72150c90c3b0e6253af7f&kb_category=de885d2187372d10695f0f66cebb351f)
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/oidc-layers)
- [Ory](https://www.ory.sh/docs/getting-started/ory-network-oauth2#authorization-code-grant)
- [Authentik](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/providers/oauth2/)
- [Zitadel](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/integrate/login/oidc)

For more detailed guides specific to each provider, see the
[Firezone legacy documentation](/docs/authenticate/oidc). Firezone 1.0 uses the
same OIDC connector under the hood as our legacy version, so the steps should
similar.

## Setting up the universal OIDC connector

To set up the universal OIDC connector, go to
`Settings -> Identity Providers -> Add Identity Provider` and select
`OpenID Connect` as the identity provider.

In general, you'll need three pieces of information to set up the connector:

- [Scopes](#scopes): These control what information Firezone can access from
  your identity provider. At a minimum, you'll need to provide the `openid`,
  `profile`, and `email` scopes. These are configured in your identity
  provider's OAuth app settings.
- [Redirect URIs](#redirect-uris): These are unique to each provider in your
  Firezone account and are used to complete the authentication process. These
  are configured in your identity provider's OAuth app settings.
- [Client ID and secret](#client-id-and-secret): These are used to authenticate
  Firezone with your identity provider. These are configured in Firezone.
- [Discovery document URI](#discovery-document-uri): This is the URL to your
  identity provider's OIDC discovery document. This is used to automatically
  configure the connector with your identity provider's settings and is
  configured in Firezone.

### Scopes

Firezone requires the following scopes to be added on the connector at a
minimum:

- `openid`: Required by all OpenID Connect integrations and used to identity
  this user in Firezone
- `profile`: Required for providing the user's name
- `email`: Required for authentication

### Redirect URIs

When setting up the connector, you'll need to provide two redirect URIs in the
connector's allowlist. These are shown in the setup form and are unique to each
provider in your Firezone account. They allow Firezone to receive authentication
tokens from your identity provider to complete the authentication process.

### Client ID and secret

You'll also need to provide the client ID and secret from your identity provider
when setting up the connector. These are used to authenticate Firezone with your
identity provider.

### Discovery document URI

The discovery document URI is the URL to your identity provider's OIDC discovery
document. This document contains all the information needed to configure the
connector with your identity provider's settings. You can usually find this URL
in your identity provider's OAuth app settings or in their OIDC documentation.

It typically looks something like this (Okta example given):

```text
https://your-tenant.okta.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

### PKCE

The universal OIDC connector **requires** the provider to support PKCE (Proof
Key for Code Exchange). PKCE is a security feature that helps prevent certain
types of attacks and is supported by nearly every OIDC provider today.

If your provider does not support PKCE, authentication will fail with an error
message similar to this:

```text
You may not authenticate to this account.
```

### Provisioning users and groups

Users must be created in Firezone before they can sign in with the universal
OIDC connector. You can [create users](/kb/deploy/users) in the admin portal or
programmatically via the [REST API](/kb/reference/rest-api).

Similarly, groups used for access control must also be created in Firezone
before they can be used with users associated with the universal OIDC connector.
You can [create groups](/kb/deploy/groups) manually in the admin portal or use
the [REST API](/kb/reference/rest-api) to create groups programmatically.

<Alert color="info">
  If you're using the [Google Workspace](/kb/authenticate/google), [Microsoft
  Entra](/kb/authenticate/entra), [Okta](/kb/authenticate/okta) connectors, or
  [JumpCloud](/kb/authenticate/jumpcloud) connectors, users and groups are
  automatically synced from your identity provider and do not need to be created
  manually.
