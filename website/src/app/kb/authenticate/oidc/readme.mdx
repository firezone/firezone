# SSO with OpenID Connect (OIDC)

<PlanBadge plans={["starter", "enterprise"]} />
</div>

Firezone supports authenticating users with a universal OIDC connector. Use this
connector to enable SSO for any OIDC-capable identity provider.

For specific instructions for a particular provider, select your provider in the
list below:

- [Fusion Auth](/kb/authenticate/oidc/fusion)

For others, use the universal setup instructions below.

## Setting up the universal OIDC connector

To set up the universal OIDC connector, go to `Settings` -> `Identity Providers`
-> `Add Identity Provider` and follow the prompts from there.

In general, you should follow your identity provider's documentation for setting
up an OIDC client. If the option is available, be sure to enable PKCE for added
security.

For more detailed guides specific to each provider, see the
[Firezone legacy documentation](/docs/authenticate/oidc). Firezone 1.0 uses the
same OIDC connector under the hood as our legacy version, so the steps should
similar.
