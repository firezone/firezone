# Static Egress IP with a NAT Gateway

Firezone can be used as NAT gateway in order to provide a single, static egress
IP for all of your team's traffic to flow out of. This is commonly used in the
following scenarios:

- Consulting engagements: Ask your client to whitelist a single static IP
  address associated with your engagement instead of your employees' individual
  device IPs.
- Masking your device IP or proxying your source IP for privacy or security
  reasons.

This guide will walk through a simple example restricting access for a
self-hosted web app to a single whitelisted static IP running Firezone.

This is commonly done in place of maintaining an IP whitelist for multiple team
members, which becomes impossible to manage as the access list grows and team
members' IP addresses change.

## AWS example

Our goal is to configure VPN traffic to the restricted resource to be routed
through a Firezone server on an EC2 instance. In this case Firezone is acting as
a network proxy or NAT gateway to provide a single public egress IP for all the
devices connected to it.

In this example the protected resource and Firezone are in separate VPC regions.

### Step 1: Deploy Firezone server

In this example, a Firezone instance has been set up on a `tc2.micro` EC2
instance. See the [Deployment Guide](/docs/deploy) for details on deploying
Firezone. Specific to AWS, ensure:

1. The security group of the Firezone EC2 instance allows outbound traffic to
   the IP of the protected resource.
1. An Elastic IP is associated with the Firezone instance. This will be the
   source IP address of traffic routed through the Firezone instance to external
   destinations. In this case, the IP is `52.202.88.54`.

/>

### Step 2: Restrict access to the protected resource

In this example, the protected resource is a self-hosted web app. Access to the
web app is restricted to only requests from `52.202.88.54`. Depending on the
resource, inbound traffic on different ports and traffic types may need to be
allowed. This is outside the scope of this guide.

/>

If the protected resource is controlled by a 3rd party, please inform the 3rd
party to allow traffic from the static IP set in Step 1 (in this case
`52.202.88.54`).

### Step 3: Route traffic to the protected resource through the VPN server

By default, all traffic from team members will be routed through Firezone and
will originate from the static IP set in Step 1 (in this case `52.202.88.54`).
However, if [split tunneling](/docs/user-guides/use-cases/split-tunnel) has been
enabled, configuration may be required to ensure the destination IP of the
protected resource is included in the `Allowed IPs`.
