# Reverse Tunneling with Firezone

This guide will walk through using Firezone as a relay to connect two devices. A
typical use case for this configuration is to enable an administrator to access
a server, container, or machine that is normally behind a NAT or firewall.

## General case: node to node

This example demonstrates a simple scenario where a tunnel is established
between Device A and Device B.

<Image
  className="mx-auto"
  alt="node to node"
  src="/images/node-to-node.png"
  width={960}
  height={540}
/>

Start by creating Device A and Device B by navigating to
`/users/[user_id]/new_device`. In the settings for each device, ensure the
following parameters are set to the values listed below. You can set device
settings when creating the device config (see
[Add Devices](/docs/user-guides/add-devices)). If you need to update settings on
an existing device, you can do so by generating a new device config.

Note `PersistentKeepalive` can also be set in on the `/settings/defaults` page
for all devices.

Device A

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.3/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Device B
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25` If the device is behind a NAT, this ensures the
  device is able to keep the tunnel alive and continue to receive packets from
  the WireGuard interface. Usually a value of `25` is sufficient, but you may
  need to decrease this value depending on your environment.

Device B

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.2/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Device A
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25`

## Admin case: one to many nodes

This example demonstrates a scenario where Device A can communicate
bi-directionally with Devices B through D. This configuration could represent an
administrator or engineer accessing multiple resources (servers, containers, or
machines) in different networks.

<Image
  className="mx-auto"
  alt="node to multiple nodes"
  src="/images/node-to-multiple-nodes.png"
  width={960}
  height={540}
/>

In the settings for each device, ensure the following parameters are set to the
values listed below. You can set device settings when creating the device config
(see [Add Devices](/docs/user-guides/add-devices)). If you need to update
settings on an existing device, you can do so by generating a new device config.

Device A (Administrator Node)

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.3/32, 10.3.2.4/32, 10.3.2.5/32`: This is the IP of
  devices B through D. Optionally you could set a range of IPs as long as it
  includes the IPs of Devices B through D.
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25` If the device is behind a NAT, this ensures the
  device is able to keep the tunnel alive and continue to receive packets from
  the WireGuard interface. Usually a value of `25` is sufficient, but you may
  need to decrease this value depending on your environment.

Device B

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.2/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Device A
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25`

Device C

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.2/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Device A
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25`

Device D

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.2/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Device A
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25`
