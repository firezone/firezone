# Add or remove users

Once you have successfully installed Firezone you'll need to add users to grant
them access to your network. This can be done through the Web UI or the
[REST API](/docs/reference/rest-api/users).

## Web UI

Add a user by clicking the "Add User" button under `/users`. You will be asked
to specify an email and a password for the user. Firezone can also integrate and
sync with an identity provider to automatically grant access to users in your
organization. See [Authenticate](/docs/authenticate) for more information.
