  Identifies the message as WAL data.

  Int64
  The starting point of the WAL data in this message.

  Int64
  The current end of WAL on the server.

  Int64
  The server's system clock at the time of transmission, as microseconds since midnight on 2000-01-01.

  Byten
  A section of the WAL data stream.

  A single WAL record is never split across two XLogData messages. When a WAL record crosses a WAL page boundary, and is therefore already split using continuation records, it can be split at the page boundary. In other words, the first main WAL record and its continuation records can be sent in different XLogData messages.
