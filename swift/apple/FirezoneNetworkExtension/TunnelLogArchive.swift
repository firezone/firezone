/// We must enable the app sandbox when distributing the macOS client in the App Store. Since the tunnel
/// process runs as root, this makes sharing log files between the app process (running as the
/// logged in user) and tunnel process (running as root) tricky. The app process can't read or write directly to
/// the tunnel's log directory, and vice-versa for the tunnel process and app log directory.
///
/// The way we overcome this is IPC. This gets tricky with exporting logs, however. We can't
/// simply read the tunnel log directory into a giant buffer as this could be too large to send over the IPC
/// channel. Instead, we write the tunnel log archive to a temp file and then chunk it over with IPC.
///
/// Since the IPC channel is unidirectional from app -> tunnel, we use a simple data format to pass chunks
/// of this archive file from the tunnel back to the app, including a boolean `done` to indicate when the
/// archive is sent and the app should close its associated file.
///
/// Currently this limit is set to 1 MB (chosen somewhat arbitrarily based on limited information found on the
/// web), but can be easily enlarged in the future to reduce the number of IPC calls required to consume
/// the entire archive. The LZFSE compression algorithm used by default in the Apple Archive Framework is
/// quite efficient -- compression ratios for our logs can be as high as 100:1 using this format.
