/// This module handles the business work of interacting with the AppleArchive framework to do the actual
/// compression. It's used from both the app and tunnel process in nearly the same way, save for how the
/// writeStream is opened.
///
/// In the tunnel process, the writeStream is a custom stream derived from our TunnelArchiveByteStream,
/// which keeps state around the writing of compressed bytes in order to handle sending chunks back to the
/// app process.
///
/// In the app process, the writeStream is derived from a passed file path where the Apple Archive
/// framework handles writing for us -- no custom byte stream instance is needed.
///
/// Once the writeStream is opened, the remaining operations are the same for both.
