## Firezone 0.5 Released!

As the first post on our new blog, we thought it'd be fitting to kick things
off with a release announcement. So without further ado, we're excited to
announce: Firezone [0.5.0 is
here](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases)!  It's packed with new
features, bug fixes, and other improvements — more on that below.

But first, we'd like to clarify our plan for plan for pricing.

### Free as in… forever?

One question we often get asked is, how much does Firezone cost? Well, now
we're able to offer some clarification around pricing. **Starting with 0.5.0,
Firezone will be entering public beta.** What's that mean for you? Two things:

- We'll be experimenting with different tiers and pricing structures based on
  an open-core business model. We plan to **always** have a version of the
  product free to use, forever. See our [new pricing
  page](https://firezone.dev/pricing) for more information.
- **Edit**: The Beta program is now closed. Thanks to all who participated!
  ~~Anyone participating in the public beta program **will receive a license key good
  for up to one year of** Firezone Team or Business. It's our way of saying
  thanks for being an early adopter and joining the program.~~

Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about all the new features in
0.5.0!

### User-scoped egress rules

Rules can now optionally receive a user scope, limiting the rule's application
only to devices owned by that user. This allows you to selectively allow or
deny traffic from a particular user to an IP, set of IPs, or CIDR range.

### Auto-renewed, ECDSA-backed, ACME-powered SSL certificates

One of our most-requested features is now available — Firezone 0.5.0 supports
ACME SSL certificate renewal backed by Let's Encrypt's new ECDSA key type.
Other providers and key types are available too. See all ACME configuration
options in our [configuration file
reference](/docs/reference/configuration-file/).

**Note**: ACME is disabled by default to remain compatible with existing
Firezone installations. To enable, set the following in your config file:

```
default['firezone']['ssl']['acme']['enabled'] = true
```

### BYORP: Bring Your Own Reverse Proxy

Want to disable Nginx and deploy Firezone under your own reverse proxy or HTTP
load balancer? Well, now you can! We've documented the required headers and
other configuration necessary to make this happen. [Check the
docs](/docs/deploy/advanced/reverse-proxy) for some configuration
examples for popular proxies. In short:

Set the
`default['firezone']['phoenix']['external_trusted_proxies']`
configuration variable to a comma-separated list containing the proxies
you'd like to receive forwarded requests from. If your proxy uses an
[RFC1918 address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network), add its
IP to `default['firezone']['phoenix']['private_clients']` instead of
`default['firezone']['phoenix']['external_trusted_proxies']`.
Update your proxy's configuration to point to Firezone, making sure to set
the `X-Forwarded-For` header and enable WebSocket connection upgrades.

**Note:** ACME support is tied to Nginx. If you disable the bundled
Firezone Nginx service, you'll need to provide your own SSL certificates
(or configure ACME renewal manually).

**Additional note:** If you go this route, you'll need to terminate SSL
yourself — Firezone sets the secure attribute on all cookies and thus
requires the downstream proxy to terminate SSL.

### Runtime configuration available in the UI

Some Firezone configuration settings are now configurable in the product UI
under the Security settings. This will override anything you have set in the
config file. Moving runtime configuration into the application itself brings us
a step closer to Docker-based deployments (coming Soon™).

### New and improved documentation

Our docs have been migrated from Jekyll to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).
Aside from all the Formatting is improved, user guides are updated and many
pages have been edited for clarify and further detail. As an added bonus, our
docs are feature improved search thanks to the powerful search functionality
provided by [DocSearch by Algolia](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).
Contributions welcome!

### Red Hat and Debian package repositories

If you're on one of our [supported
distros](/docs/deploy/omnibus/supported-platforms/) (or its
derivatives), the one-line install script will automatically install Firezone
from our package repository and track further updates from there. This means
your Firezone installation can be managed like any other package on your system
and will be marked for upgrades by the same apt and yum tools you're already
familiar with. Be sure to check the [upgrade
notes](/docs/administer/upgrade/) prior to each
upgrade in case there are any backwards-incompatible changes or manual steps
involved.

If you've got an existing installation and still want to add our package
repository for easier package management, just follow the [relevant
section](/docs/deploy/omnibus) in the manual
install guide.

### Smaller package sizes

Speaking of packages, we've done a bit of work reducing the size of our Omnibus
release package. The Nodejs, Python, Erlang, and Elixir runtimes have all been
removed, reducing the package size by 50% and total installed size by even
more. There's still lots of work to be done to be done here —  we expect
package sizes to be reduced even further moving forward.

### Custom landing page logo

In the first round of what we hope to be the start of a full-featured
customization experience, it's now possible to change the landing page logo.
Upload an image up to 1 MB or specify a URL to an image your end users will see
when landing at your Firezone portal.

## Conclusion

That's all we've got for now. If you'd like to spin up Firezone to try it out,
head to the [deploy guide](/docs/deploy) in our docs.
