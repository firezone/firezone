Firezone employs a few different security controls to keep data secure in
transit and at rest.

## Overview of Cryptography Used

Below is a table of cryptography used and to which contexts they apply.

| Cryptography                                             | Context         | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---                                                      | ---             | ---                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| AES-GCM                                                  | Data at rest    | Used to encrypt sensitive database fields such as device preshared keys and multi-factor authentication secrets.                                                                                                                           |
| Argon2                                                   | Data at rest    | Used to hash user passwords for the local authentication method.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| TLSv1.2/TLSv1.3                                          | Data in transit | Used by the Caddy server to encrypt HTTP connections to the portal. Read more at https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls. SSL certificates are provisioned automatically with the ACME protocol by Let's Encrypt by default. |
| ChaCha20, Poly1305, Curve25519, BLAKE2s, SipHash24, HKDF | Data in transit | Used by WireGuard® for VPN tunnels. Read more at https://wireguard.com/protocol. Firezone uses Linux kernel WireGuard without modification.                                                                                                |
