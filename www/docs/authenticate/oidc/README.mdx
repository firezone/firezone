# Integrate your identity provider using OIDC

Firezone supports Single Sign-On (SSO) via OpenID Connect (OIDC).

## Supported identity providers

In general, most identity providers that offer OIDC support work with Firezone. Some providers
that only implement the OIDC partially or use uncommon configurations may have
issues, however. If your identity provider falls into this category, [contact us
](/sales) about a custom integration.

The following OIDC providers are known to work well with Firezone:

| Provider                              | Support Status                 | Notes                                                                                                                                                  |

| [Auth0](auth0)                        | **Fully tested and supported** | Auth0 does not provide an `end_session_uri` in its OIDC discovery document. Signing out of Auth0 from Firezone is not supported.                       |

## General setup guide

If you're using an OIDC provider not listed above, the following OIDC attributes
are required for setting up an OIDC provider in Firezone:

1. `discovery_document_uri`: The
   [OpenID Connect provider configuration URI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig)
   which returns a JSON document used to construct subsequent requests to this
   OIDC provider. Some providers refer to this as the "well-known URL".
1. `client_id`: The client ID of the application.
1. `client_secret`: The client secret of the application.
1. `redirect_uri`: Instructs OIDC provider where to redirect after authentication.
   This should be your Firezone `EXTERNAL_URL + /auth/oidc/<provider_key>/callback/`
   (e.g. `https://firezone.example.com/auth/oidc/google/callback/`).
1. `response_type`: Set to `code`.
1. `scope`: [OIDC scopes](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html#Scopes)
   to obtain from your OIDC provider. At a minimum, Firezone requires the `openid`
   and `email` scopes.
1. `label`: The button label text displayed on the Firezone portal login page.

### PKCE

Firezone supports Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for increased login security.
We recommend you enable PKCE in your IdP's settings whenever available. [Read more
about PKCE here](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/).

### OIDC logout URI

The OpenID Connect standard [defines a mechanism](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-rpinitiated-1_0.html)
for a Relying Party (RP) to request that an OpenID Provider log out the End-User.

Unfortunately, not all IdPs support this (e.g. Google, Auth0). For the providers
that do support this mechanism, Firezone automatically detects the `end_session_uri`
found in the provider's discovery document and uses that to log out the End-User.
