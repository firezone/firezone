/// - Setting IP addresses
/// - Defining routes

/// In our implementation, we don't want to use any of that.
/// Our device is entirely backed by in-memory buffers and we and selectively feed IP packets to it.
/// Therefore, we configure it to:
/// - Accept any packet
/// - Define dummy IPs (localhost for IPv4 and IPv6)
/// - Define catch-all routes (0.0.0.0/0) that routes all traffic to the interface
