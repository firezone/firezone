    If the DF flag is not set and the IPv4 packet will result in an IPv6
    packet larger than 1280 bytes, the packet SHOULD be fragmented so the
    resulting IPv6 packet (with Fragment Header added to each fragment)
    will be less than or equal to 1280 bytes.  For example, if the packet

    is fragmented prior to the translation, the IPv4 packets should be
    fragmented so that their length, excluding the IPv4 header, is at
    most 1232 bytes (1280 minus 40 for the IPv6 header and 8 for the
    Fragment Header).  The translator MAY provide a configuration
    function for the network administrator to adjust the threshold of the
    minimum IPv6 MTU to a value greater than 1280-byte if the real value
    of the minimum IPv6 MTU in the network is known to the administrator.
    The resulting fragments are then translated independently using the
    logic described below.

    If the DF bit is set and the MTU of the next-hop interface is less
    than the total length value of the IPv4 packet plus 20, the
    translator MUST send an ICMPv4 "Fragmentation Needed" error message
    to the IPv4 source address.

    If the DF bit is set and the packet is not a fragment (i.e., the More
    Fragments (MF) flag is not set and the Fragment Offset is equal to
    zero), then the translator SHOULD NOT add a Fragment Header to the
    resulting packet.
